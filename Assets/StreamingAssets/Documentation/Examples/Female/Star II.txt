Large swaths of regal orchid contrasts with dark oak throughout most of the manor.
Judging from the dozens of rooms I have walked through, there are at least 40 people on staff here. Maybe more. 
{additive:on} 
Some of those people were not human.
They looked more like Demi humans, like from video games or from anime that Shirobi would watch.
There were even species I couldn't recognize. 
Were they other V-Tubers? Or something different altogether?
{additive:off}
So many rooms. I could see at least two waiting rooms, a ball room, and a library. 
Lucas was humming some unidentifiable tune I could not recognize. 
Every time I tried to ask him what it was, he would hush me and motion forward. 
This room matches the rest of the manor.
Set up in a simple yet elegant decor. 
Dark purple and ancient oak.
Oh!

Asterella Star, 
Lord of the 69th Circle of Hell,
leaning back in comfort on the crushed velvet sofa.

She looks up as we come in, shifting a bit and exposing pale, bare skin underneath a veneer, lavender shift.
I can't mistake her. The long, delicate horns. The floating crown of blue diamonds. 
She is shorter than I thought she would be. Her curves though.
Ara Ara...
