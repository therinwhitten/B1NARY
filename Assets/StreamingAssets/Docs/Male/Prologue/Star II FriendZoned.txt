[Confusion]
"Well...I honestly didn't expect that."

MC::

Asterella::
[Default]
"Especially an intruder."
MC::

"I guess I can't blame you. You are here against your will.

MC::

I feel like she knows that. 
Asterella::
"Well, Lucas will support whatever I want to do."
"He may complain, but in the end he will respect my decisions."
"You shouldn't worry about him in the future."
