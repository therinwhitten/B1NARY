MC::
It took at least 5 mins of walking to get to the center of the manor. 
Yep. Still tied up.
The mansion is almost a small village by itself, with many different rooms.
I lost count at 50 people in the short time I was counting. 
A lot of them were not human.  
Some cat girls too!
MC::
Mah Heart... 
And.
Szycrotic has been humming songs under his breath the entire way. 
{moveChar: Asterella, .65}
{additive: on}
As we enter, 
a stunning young lady, 
reading a book on the couch,
looks up at us.
{additive:off}
The floating crown made of diamond. The long slender horns. 
{additive: on}
Those black and lavender eyes.
This was surely Asterella Star. 
{additive: off}
{additive: on}
The transparent, orchid silk material, shifts suggestively, 
hugging her form in a very sensual way.
{additive: off} 
Seeing her in person, with no screen. No barriers...
{fadeinsound: Heart Thump, .1}
My heart thumps in response. 
Asterella::
[Annoyed]
"Szy!" 
MC::
That dulcet voice is full of exasperation.
Asterella::
{if: !n-b}
{
 {additive:on}
 "I told you to <i>bring</i> him in,
 not beat him up and drag him!" 
 {additive:off}
}
{if: n-b}
{
 {additive:on}
 "I told you to <i>bring</i> them in,
 not beat them up and drag them!"
 {additive:off}
}
MC::
Szycrotic shrugs, a hint of defensiveness squaring up his shoulders. 
Szycrotic::
[Default]
{if: !n-b}
{
 "Star, he literally tried to book it."
 "So, naturally. I tied him up."
 "Don't blame me! I think it's his kink."
}
{if: n-b}
{
 "Star, they literally tried to book it."
 "So, naturally. I tied MC up."
 "Don't blame me! I think it's their kink."
}
MC::
I open my mouth to protest that I do <i>not</i> have a rope fetish. 
Asterella::
{anim: Asterella, Pouting}
{movecube: .7, .7}
"I can't have you beating up people that come into my realm!"
{movecube: .5, .4}
"What if they are a visiting Demon Lord?"
Szycrotic::
"But-"
[OWO]
Asterella::
{anim: Asterella, Pouting}
{if: !n-b}
{
 "Even if they seem to be intruders! What if he was a Demon Lord in disguise?"
} 
{if: n-b}
{
 "Even if they seem to be intruders! What if the were a Demon Lord in disguise?"
} 
MC::
Szycrotic looks at me thoughtfully.
Star shakes her head in visible frustration. 
She raises her hand slowly.
And points to the door with finality: decision made.
Asterella::
[Indifference]
"Leave me." 
{additive:on}
"See the Dungeon Master for your nightly punishment.
I will put out this fire you made."
{additive:off}
MC::
Nightly punishment?
Uh oh. 
What did I drag myself into?
Up close, the whole experience is surreal.
{additive: on} 
This is not some V-Tuber stream.
They seem to <i>live</i> here.
{additive: off}
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .1}
Szycrotic::
[Angry]
"Fine, woman."
{if: !n-b}
{
 "If he becomes hostile don't blame me, alright?"
}
{if: n-b}
{
 "If they become hostile don't blame me, alright?"
}
{moveChar: Szycrotic, -1}
{moveChar: Asterella, .5}
{movecube: .2, .4}
MC::
{fadeinsound: openclosedoor, 1}
Star watches Szy close the door with a look of satisfaction on her face. 
When the door closes she sighs, closing her eyes for a brief moment. 
Asterella::
[Happy]
{anim: Asterella, Thinking}
"I swear he'll start a war someday."
MC::
The light giggle that escapes her throat is oddly not surprising. 
They seem to be very close to each other.
As if deciding something, she focuses on me, her eyes apologetic.
{movecube: .5, .1}
Asterella::
[Default]
"Ok, let's get those ropes off of you."
I am <i>so</i> sorry... um..."
MC::
She moves towards me, the swish of her night gown light.
"MC. Nice to meet you. Lord Asterella Star?"
There is an air of regal authority in her that I cannot ignore.
A person comfortable with command. 
Better to play it safe. 
"I would naturally shake hands but I'm kinda tied up at the moment."
I laugh a bit dryly. 
Asterella::
"With jokes like that, maybe I should keep you tied up."
[Happy]
MC::
She looks at me with a wry twist of her lips.
{movecube: .5, 0}
Extends one fingernail and slices the ropes off my wrists and throat. 
The nail cuts like a knife. 
No wonder Szycrotic wasn't worried. 
Wait, was that a warning? 
I intend to take it as one.
{movecube: .5, .2}
Asterella Star, not a foot from my face.
In the flesh. 
{if: henable}
{
	{if: n-b}
 {
   Be a gentleperson.
 }
 {if: !n-b}
 {
   Be a gentleman. 
 }
 She is short, her head only coming up to my mid chest.  
 My eyes can't help but lock on her bouncing "assets."
 Task Failed Successfully.

{if: !henable}
{
	She is short, her head only coming up to my mid chest.
 {if: n-b}
 {
   Being a gentleperson, I lock eyes with her.
 }
 {if: !n-b}
 {
  Being a gentleman, I lock eyes with her. 
 }
 Those gorgeous eyes. 
}
The scent of her billows into small space of air between us: brimstone with a mix of lavender.
It's intoxicating...
Asterella::
[Default] 
"And Star is fine, MC. My official title is saved for formal ceremonies."
{additive:on}
{anim: Asterella, Pouting}
"Where are my manners? 
Please excuse me.
Have a seat on the sofa, let me get you some wine."
{additive:off}
MC::
She glides gracefully to the sofa, sitting with the grace of a queen.
{moveChar: Asterella, .4} 
{movecube: .4, .2}
With an elegant hand, she pats the sofa cushion next to her suggestively.
It's an invitation.
Asterella::
"Come, I won't bite."
[Happy]
MC::
A mischievous look appears on her delicate features.
Asterella::
"Unless you <i>want</i> me too, of course."
{anim: Asterella, Smug}
MC::
I swallow.
It's <i>not</i> what you think. 
It <i>can't</i> be what you are thinking.
Get a hold of yourself!
"So, Star. Why did you bring me to your room?"
Asterella::
{movecube: .4, .1}
[Default]
MC::
{fadeinsound: woodwine1, .1}
{fadeinsound: woodwine2, .1}
{fadeinsound: Pouring, .1}
Asterella grabs the second champagne glass, pouring crimson wine from a crystal chalice.
Lightly, she places the goblet on the table next to her. 
{fadeinsound: wineglassdown, .1}
Asterella::
{additive: on}
"Other than the fact that you are an unknown? 
Suddenly appearing without authorization into my realm? 
{movecube: .4, .3}
As if you own it?"
{additive:off}
MC::
She holds my gaze, studying my reaction.
Asterella::
"Why would I need another reason? I think it's perfectly acceptable to be cautious, MC."
MC:: 
Not yet.
"This is not the kind of hospitality you give an intruder."
It's a statement. 
I am probably putting my foot in my mouth, but I need to know. 
"You <i>should</i> be sending me to the dungeon to torture at your pleasure to get answers."
Asterella looks up while calmly grabbing her wine. 
{anim: Asterella, Thinking}
Asterella::
"No, that just won't do. The dungeon is for good boys and girls." 
"You see, things work differently in hell."
MC::
Her tone is a matter of fact, but gentle: as if it is perfectly normal to be punished for fun.
It unnerves me even more. 
Some serious BDSM vibes going on here. 
That's not entirely a bad thing.
Still...
{additive:on}
My decision made, 
I walk over and sit down in front of the chalice, 
reaching out and taking it with a bit of hesitation.
The wine is a very dark red, 
almost black in the moonlight.
I swish it gently, 
watching parts of the wine sparkle.
{additive:off}
Star raises her glass.
Asterella::
"To future relationships."
MC::
"To future relationships."
{fadeinsound: Wine Toast, .1}
{anim: Asterella, Impatient}
I take a nice chug of it. 
It burns a bit, but the taste is smooth. 
My voice lowers a bit. 
"Fair point, I guess."
Here goes nothing.
"What if I told you that I had no idea why I am here, and it was a random occurrence?"
Star frowns, studying me again carefully.
{anim: Asterella, Thinking}
For a very uncomfortable period, the room, the air, is cold.  
Finally, she speaks.
Asterella::
"I can tell you are speaking the truth."
"That doesn't explain where you came from though."
MC::
I pipe in.
"What would you say if I said I came from the Twatch servers?"
{movecube: .4, .1}
She smiles sweetly, one that doesn't reach her eyes.
A glint starts to ignite in her eyes dangerously.
Sudden as a firecracker.
Asterella::
[Disgust]
"And that would be a complete lie." 
{movecube: .4, .3}
"Don't test the waters with me, MC." 
{additive:on}
"I may be forgiving and merciful, 
but I despise lying."
{additive:off}
MC::
She pauses.
{anim: Asterella, Thinking}
Asterella::
[Default]
"At least to me, anyway."
"Do you pose a threat to my kingdom?"
"Or, perhaps, the other Circles of Hell?"
MC::
Do I?
I have nothing to do with any of this. I am a clueless explorer. 
I don't even know where I am actually at. 
"No, nothing like that."
I laugh it off, dismissing the notion.
"If I did, why would I just <i>waltz</i> in here as a prisoner?"
It was her turn to laugh.
Asterella::
[Happy]
"Touche, MC. I suppose we are at an information impasse..."
"For now, anyway."
[Default]
MC::
{additive:on}
She's mulling something over,  
studying me over her glass, 
those penetrating eyes softening.
{additive:off}
Asterella::
"You refuse to disclose where you came from."
MC::
Her eyes narrow just a touch.
Asterella::
"And yet, I sense no malice from you. No hostile intention."
MC:: 
She takes another sip and moves a bit closer to me on the couch. 
{additive: on}
The scent of her returns to my nostrils, 
heady and thick.
{additive:off}
Close enough for thighs to touch, she looks up at me through her lashes suggestively.
Asterella::
{anim: Asterella, Smug}
[Happy]
"There are <i>other</i> ways to get information from you."
MC::
What exactly does <i>that</i> mean?
I swallow again. 
The vibes are unmistakable.
Am I being seduced here??
No way...
She confirms my suspicions by placing a gentle hand on my leg.
Play it cool, MC. Play it cool.
You're cool as a cucumber.
Asterella::
{if: !n-b}
{
 "Don't play dumb with me, MC. You seem to be a very kind, attractive elf boy, and I am a bit 'thirsty'..."
}
{if: n-b}
{
 "Don't play dumb with me, MC. You seem to be a very kind, attractive elf, and I am a bit 'thirsty'..."
}
"And it's not for more wine."
MC::
The look on her face speaks volumes on what her true intentions were.
{if: henable}
{
	{additive:on}
	And, like a true virgin (it's been that long), 
	my fickle pickle rises like the dark knight.
	{additive:off}
	At least I know it works now, right?
	It isn't a priority, of course.
	Good to know the little man can wake up.
	I almost embarrass myself by choking on my wine. 
}
{if: !henable}
{
	My heart leaps to my throat. The gentle feeling becomes more assertive.
	This can't be happening... 
	I almost embarrass myself by choking on my wine. 
	"Wait, right now?"
	I manage to keep my voice from squeaking. 
	Quite proud of that one. 
	Star gently begins caressing my leg.
}
{if: henable}
{
	Getting incredibly close to my crotch.
	I feel my little man twitch. 
	Her movements become more assertive.
}
{if: !henable}
{
	This is getting serious fast.
	Her motions become more assertive, and she looks into my eyes... 
	{additive: on}
	Those eyes:
	so beautiful, 
	gentle, yet aggressively hungry.
	{additive:off} 
}
A sure smile slowly envelopes her face: a smile of satisfaction.
Asterella::
"Your body cannot lie to me, MC. I know you want me as well."
MC:: 
She looks almost pouty, her cheeks puffing just slightly.
{anim: Asterella, Pouting}
Asterella::
"You wouldn't deny a Demon Lord in her own domain would you?"
{movecube: .4, .1}
"As an intruder to boot."
MC:: 
What do I say?
She is breathtaking: soft in all the right places. 
Demon Lord role aside, as a woman: she is graceful, confident, and daring.
Qualities I admire in a woman. 
Yet, the suddenness of this situation has me a bit hesitant.
My body is screaming for me to take her offer. 
My mind is screaming she's a Demon Lord. 
I am in an unknown situation, with dark pits all around me.
Not to mention that demon "enjoying" himself in the dungeon tonight can cause problems with either decision I make. 
Am I hurting the realm if I hurt her feelings?
Will Szycrotic be enraged if I go with Star's suggestion?
{movecube: .4, .3}
{choice: What should I do?}
{
	I answer her by pulling her to my chest, gently raising her chin.
