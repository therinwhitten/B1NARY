{moveChar: Szycrotic, .25}
MC::
It took at least 5 mins of walking to get here. 
Yes.....I am still tied up.
The mansion is almost a small village by itself, with many different rooms.
I lost count at 50 people in the short time I was counting. 
Alot of them were not human. Some had horns, tails, and scales here and there. 
Some cat girls too.
MC::
Mah Heart! 
And.....
Szycrotic has been humming songs under his breath the entire way. 
{moveChar: Asterella, .75}
{additive: on}
As we come in, 
a stunning, young lady, 
reading a book on the couch,
looks up at us as we enter. 
{additive:off}
The floating crown made of diamonds, the long, slender horns. 
{additive: on}
Those black and lavendar eyes. 
This was surely Asterella Star. 
{additive: off}
{additive: on}
The transparent, orchid silk material, shifts suggestively, 
hugging her form in a very... sensual way.
{additive: off} 
Seeing her in person, with no screen. No barriers....
{fadeinsound: Heart Thump, .1}
My heart thumps in response. 
Asterella::
"Szy!" 
MC::
That dulcet voice is full of exasperation.
Asterella::
{additive:on}
"I told you to BRING him,
not beat him up and drag him!"
{additive:off}
MC::
Szycrotic shrugs, a hint of defensiveness squaring up his shoulders. 
Szycrotic::
"Star, he literally tried to book it."
"So, naturally.....I tied him up."
"Don't blame me. I think it's his kink."
MC::
I open my mouth to protest that I do NOT have a rope fetish. 
Asterella::
"I can't have you beating up random people that come into my realm?!"
"What if they are a visiting Demon Lord, Szy?"
Szycrotic::
"But..."
Asterella::
"Even if they seem to be intruders! What if he was a passive Demon Lord?"
MC::
Szycrotic looks at me thoughfully. 
Star shakes her head in visible frustration. 
She raises her hand slowly...
And points to the door with a finality: decision made.
Asterella::
"Leave me." 
{additive:on}
"See the dungeon master for your nightly punishment.
I will put out this fire you made."
{additive:off}
MC::
Nightly....punishment???
Oh oh. 
What did I drag myself into?
Up close, the whole experience is surreal.
{additive: on} 
This is not some V-Tuber stream.
They seem to LIVE here. 
{additive: off}
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .1}
Szycrotic::
"Fine woman."
"If he suddenly becomes hostile, don't blame me alright?"
{moveChar: Szycrotic, -1}
{moveChar: Asterella, .5}
MC::
{fadeinsound: Door, 1}
Star watches Szy close the door, with a look of satisfaction on her face. 
When the door closes, she sighs, closing her eyes for a brief moment. 
Asterella::
"I swear he will cause a war someday."
MC::
The light giggle that escapes her throat is oddly, not surprising. 
They seem to be very comfortable with each other. 
Asterella::
"Ok, let's get those ropes off of you."
I am soooooo sorry.....um.."
MC::
She moves towards me, the swish of her night gown light.
"MC. Nice to meet you.......Lord Star?"
There is an air of regal authority in her that I cannot ignore.
A person comfortable with command. 
Better to play it safe. 
"I would naturally shake hands but...kinda tied up atm the moment."
I laugh a bit dryly. 
Asterella::
"With jokes like that, maybe I should keep you tied up..."
MC::
She looks at me with a wry twist of her lips.....
Extends one fingernail and slices the ropes off of my wrists and throat. 
The nail cut like it is a knife all by itself.........
No wonder Szycrotic wasn't worried. 
Wait....was that a warning? 
I intend to take it as one.
Asterella Star, not a foot from my face.
In the flesh. 

**TODO: henable**
if: henabled, true

Be a gentleman. 
She is short, her head only coming up to my mid chest. 
My eyes can't help but lock on her bouncing "assets."
Task Failed Successfully.

if: henable, false

She is short, her head only coming up to my mid chest.
Being a gentleman, I lock eyes with her. 
Those gorgeous eyes......

The scent of her billows into small space of air between us: brimstone with a mix of lavender.
It's intoxicating.....
Asterella::
{additive:on}
"Where are my manners? 
Please excuse me.
Have a seat on the sofa, help yourself to some wine."
{additive:off}
MC::
She glides gracefully to the sofa, sitting herself with the grace of a queen. 
With an elegant hand, she pats the the sofa cushion next to her lightly.
Asterella::
"Come, I won't bite, unless you ask me to."
MC::
I swallow heavily.
It is not what you think. 
It CAN'T be what you are thinking.
Get a hold of yourself.
"Why did you bring me here?"
{fadeinsound: woodwine1, .1}
{fadeinsound: woodwine2, .1}
{fadeinsound: glasspouring, .1}
Asterella grabs the second champagne glass, pouring crimson wine from a crystal chalice.
Lightly, she places the goblet on the table next to her. 
{fadeinsound: wineglassdown, .1}
Asterella::
{additive: on}
"Other than the fact that you are an unknown? 
Suddenly appearing without authorization into my realm? 
As if you own it?"
{additive:off}
"As if I need any another reason than that?"
MC:: 
Not yet.
"This is not the kind of hospitality you give an intruder."
"You would be sending me to the dungeon to torture at your pleasure to get answers."
Asterella looks up while calmly grabbing her wine. 
Asterella::
"No, the dungeon is for good subjects." 
"Things work differently in Hell."
MC::
Her tone is gentle, but matter of fact. 
It unnerves me even more. 
Some serious BDSM vibes going on here. 
That is not entirely a bad thing.
Still.....
{additive:on}
I walk over and sit down in front of the chalice, 
reaching out and taking it with a bit of hesitation.
The wine is a very dark red, 
almost black in the moonlight.
I swish it gently, 
watching parts of the wine sparkle.....
{additive:off}
Star raises her glass.
Asterella::
"To future relationships."
MC::
"To future relationships."
{fadeinsound: winetoast, .1}
And take a nice chug of it. 
It burns a bit, but the taste is smooth. 
"Fair point....I guess."
Here goes nothing.
"What if I told you that I had no idea why I am here, and it was a random occurence?"
Star frowns, studying my eyes with intention.
For a very uncomfortable period, the room, the air, is cold.  
Finally, she speaks.
Asterella::
"I can tell you are speaking truth."
"That doesn't explain where you came from though."
MC::
I pipe in.
"What would you say if I came from the Twatch servers?"
She smiles sweetly, one that doesn't reach her eyes.
A glint starts to ignite in her eyes dangerously.
Careful MC.....
Asterella::
"And that would be a complete lie."
"Don't test the waters with me." 
{additive:on}
"I may be a nice Demon Lord, 
but I despise lying."
{additive:off}
MC::
She pauses.
Asterella::
"At least to me."
"Do you pose a threat to my kingdom?"
"Or, perhaps, the rest of the Circles of Hell?"
MC::
Do I?
I have nothing to do with any of this. I am a clueless explorer. 
I don't even know where I am actually at. 
"No, nothing like that."
I laugh it off, genuinely.
"If I did, why would I just waltz in here as a prisoner?"
It was her turn to laugh.
Asterella::
"Touche, MC. I suppose we are at an information impasse...."
"For now, anyway."
MC::
{additive:on}
She regards me carefully, 
studying me over her glass, 
those penetrating eyes softening.
{additive:off}
"You refuse to disclose where you came form."
MC::
Her eyes narrow just a touch.
Asterella::
"And yet, I sense no malice from that."
MC:: 
She takes another sip and moves a bit closer to me on the couch. 
{additive: on}
The scent of her returns to my nostrils, 
heady and thick.
{additive:off}
Close enough for thighs to touch, she looks up at me through her lashes suggestively.
Asterella::
"There are other ways to get information from you."
MC::
WHAT......DOES THAT MEAN?!
I swallow again. 
The vibes are unmistakable.
She confirms them by placing a gentle hand on my leg.
Play it cool, MC. Play it cool......
Asterella::
"Don't play dumb with me, MC. You are a cute, and exotic-looking elf boy,  and I am a bit 'thirsty'."
"And it's not for more wine."
MC::
The look on her face speaks volumes on what her true intentions were.

**TODO: henable**

if: henable, true

And.....like a true virgin (it's been that long), my fickle pickle rises like the dark knight.
{additive:on}
At least I know it works now right?
Being digitized and all. 
{additive:off}
Honestly, I almost embarrass myself by choking on my wine. 

if: henable, false

My heart leaps to my throat. The gentle feeling becomes more assertive. 
Honestly, I almost embarrass myself by choking on my wine. 

"Wait, right now?"
I manage to keep my voice from squeaking. 
Quite proud of that one. 
Star gently begins caressing my leg......

**TODO: henable**

if: henable, true
Getting incredibly close to my crotch.
I feel my little man twitch. 

if: henable, false
This is getting serious fast. 
{additive: on}
Those eyes:
pleading, 
yet aggressive and sure.
{additive:off} 

A sure smile slowly envelopes her face: a smile of satisfaction.
Asterella::
"Your body cannot lie to me, MC. I know you want this."
"I, too, want to drink the ambrosia."
MC:: 
She looks almost pouty, her cheeks puffing just slightly.
Asterella::
{additive:on}
"You wouldn't deny a Demon Lord, 
in her own domain, 
would you?"
{additive:off}
"As an intruder to boot...."
MC:: 
What do I say?
She is breathtaking: soft in all the right places. 
Demon Lord role aside, as a woman: she is graceful, confident, and daring.
Qualities I admire in a woman. 
Yet, the suddeness of this situation has me a bit hesitant.
My body is screaming for me to take her offer. 
My mind is screaming she is a Demon Lord. 
I am in an unknown situation, with unknowns all around me.
Not to mention that demon "enjoying" himself in the dungeon tonight can cause problems with either decision I make. 
Am I hurting the realm if I hurt her feelings?
Will Szycrotic be enraged if I go with Star's suggestions?
