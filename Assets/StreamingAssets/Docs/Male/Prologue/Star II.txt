MC::
It took at least 5 mins of walking to get here. 
Yes.....I am still tied up.
The mansion is almost a small village by itself, with many different rooms.
I lost count at 50 people in the short time I was counting. 
And.....
Szycrotic has been humming songs under his breath the entire way. 
{moveChar: Asterella, .75}
{additive: on}
As we come in, 
a stunning, young lady, 
reading a book on the couch,
looks up at us as we enter. 
{additive:off}
The floating crown made of diamonds, the long, slender horns. 
{additive: on}
Those black and lavendar eyes. 
This was surely Asterella Star. 
{additive: off}
{additive: on}
The transparent, orchid silk material, shifts suggestively, 
hugging her form in a very... sensual way.
{additive: off} 
Seeing her in person, with no screen. No barriers....
{fadeinsound: Heart Thump, .1}
My heart thumps in response. 
Asterella::
"Szy!" 
MC::
That dulcet voice is full of exasperation.
Asterella::
{additive:on}
"I told you to BRING him,
not beat him up and drag him!"
{additive:off}
MC::
Szycrotic shrugs, a hint of defensiveness squaring up his shoulders. 
Szycrotic::
"Star, he literally tried to book it."
"So, naturally.....I tied him up."
"Don't blame me. I think it's his kink."
MC::
I open my mouth to protest that I do NOT have a rope fetish. 
Asterella::
"I can't have you beating up random people that come into my realm?!"
"What if they are a visiting Demon Lord, Szy?"
Szycrotic::
"But..."
Asterella::
"Even if they seem to be intruders! What if he was a passive Demon Lord?"
MC::
Szycrotic looks at me thoughfully. 
Asterella points to the door with a finality. 
Asterella::
"Leave me." 
{additive:on}
"See the dungeon master for your nightly punishment.
I will put out this fire you made."
{additive:off}
MC::
Nightly....punishment???
Oh oh. 
What did I drag myself into?
Up close, the whole experience is surreal.
{additive: on} 
This is not some V-Tuber stream.
They seem to LIVE here. 
{additive: off}
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .1}
Szycrotic::
"Fine woman."
"If he suddenly becomes hostile, don't blame me alright?"
{moveChar: Szycrotic, -1}
{moveChar: Asterella, .5}
MC::
{fadeinsound: Door, 1}
Star watches Szy close the door, with a look of satisfaction on her face. 
When the door closes, she sighs, closing her eyes for a brief moment. 
Asterella::
"I swear he will cause a war someday."
MC::
The light giggle that escapes her throat is oddly, not surprising. 
They seem to be very comfortable with each other. 
Asterella::
"Oh let's get those ropes off of you."
I am soooooo sorry.....um.."
MC::
She moves towards me, the swish of her night gown light.
I smell a light scent of lemon and lavendar on her. 
"MC. Nice to meet you.......Lord Star?"
There is an air of regal authority in her that I cannot ignore.
A person comfortable with command. 
Better to play it safe. 
"I would naturally shake hands but...kinda tied up atm the moment."
I laugh a bit dryly. 
Asterella::
"With jokes like that, maybe I should keep you tied up..."
MC::
She looks at me with a wry twist of her lips.....
Extends one fingernail and slices the ropes off of my wrists and throat. 
The nail cut like it is a knife all by itself.........
No wonder Szycrotic wasn't worried. 
Wait....was that a warning? 
I intend to take it as one.
