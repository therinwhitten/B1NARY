Finally,
after what seems like an eternity, 
{if: n-b,false}
{
 his face goes completely flaccid.

 their face relaxes.

 His eyes slowly close, peaceful now, devoid of any expression.

It seems almost anti-climatic as the hum of the digitizer just...
ceases,
the inert body limp on the seat.

As the press look on, cameras rolling, a team of medics with a cryotube slowly enter through the doorway along with medical equipment, efficiently prepping the cryochamber.
{fadeinsound: Medic Stretcher, .1}
Inside the press room, the silence is palpable.
The press share glances, sip coffee, scribble down notes, waiting impatiently for <i>any</i> information.
It felt like several hours to some, time gelling. 
The transfer took only a few minutes. 
Fluorescent lights in the lab crackle and come to life...
{fadeinsound: fluorescent light flicker, .2}
{if: n-b,false}
{
  Medics grab MC, carefully placing him into the cyrotube and applying sensors to the different sections of his body.

{if: n-b,true}
{
 Medics grab MC, carefully placing them into the cryotube and applying sensors to the different sections of their body.

MC looks so lifeless, it even unnerves the veteran journalist, John.
With a pneumatic swoosh, the stasis chamber closes with MC inside. 
{fadeinsound: CryoStasis Close, .1}
{fadeinsound: Slow Heartbeat Machine, .1}
The stasis chamber looks like nothing John has ever seen before, touchscreens covering the top of the lid.
John can hear the heart rate monitor, even in the "press room." Even through the thick panel of glass. 
John looks around.
"Press room." It is basically the lab techs' break room. 
{if: n-b,false}
{
 At least for the boy, Digital Horizons has spared no expense.
} 
{if: n-b,true}
{
 At least for this employee, Digital Horizons has spared no expense.
}
That knowledge does little to settle the onlookers though. 
Through the panel of glass, lab-techs manning the laptops call over their Team Leader.
{fadeinsound: LabCrewLeavingFootsteps, .1}
{additive: on}
John cannot follow the discussion, their lips are not in direct sight,
but he can surmise careful discourse is happening.
{additive: off}
Like any good reporter, John smells a scoop.
As the team continues the discussion, the medics remove the body, and the doors are shut tight. 
{fadeinsound: openclosedoor, 2}
{fadeoutsound: Lab Computer Room Beeps 2, 4}
{fadeoutsound: Slow Heartbeat Machine, 4}
{fadeoutsound: LabAmbience, 4}
Once the doors close, the clicking of a single laptop keyboard can be heard from one of the other reporters. 
Sounds from the lab are effectively cut off, save for a single loudspeaker next to the window. 
Suddenly, the sound of Cindy's silky voice pops up in John's earpiece, startling him.
Cindy::
"John?"
{additive:on}
"Everything ok? 
We cut the feed to you until the announcement. 
And let me tell you, 
that was some great footage... What's happening now?"
{additive: off}
Narrator::
John cups one hand to his ear, activating the auto talk function.
John::
"Stand by Cindy. I think the Lab Supervisor is about to speak."
Narrator::
He continues to observe closely. Something is different.
Cliff, the Project Lead, is leaning over a lab tech's laptop, his back to the room. 
{additive: on}
As he's asking questions,
tension stiffens Cliff's back.
John watches closely.
{additive: off}
{spawnChar: malesilo, -1, Cliff}

{moveChar: Cliff, .50}
Cliff then stands up straight with confidence, turning to the press window.
With a dramatic clearing of his throat, he speaks, projecting his voice. 
{additive: on}
Cliff::
"To the denizens of Earth.
I can officially announce the successful transfer of MC into the digital realm."
{additive: off}
Narrator::
He pauses for effect, making eye contact with the press through the observation window, one by one.
When he observes them talking amongst themselves, he continues, voice strong and steady.
Cliff::

"I officially pronounce this experiment a resounding success!"
Narrator::
{fadeinsound: Press Conference Long, 1}
{fadeinsound: smallgroupwhisper, 1}
The symphony of camera shutters, and the flashing of lights, erupts as he makes his announcement to the world.
{additive: on}
That simple statement brings considerable excitement.
The pent up tension ripples through the reporters like waves in a pond.
{additive: off}
John::
<i>What are you hiding, Cliff?</i>
Narrator::
The raising of hands, like a wave themselves, plead for Cliff's attention.  
Cliff points to one young reporter, a lady from another news channel.
{anim: Cliff, kime1}
Cliff::
"Yes, you there. Go ahead and ask your question."
{anim: Cliff, kime2}
Narrator::
She purses her lips, nervous.
Female Reporter::
"There are many concerns about the risks involved with an experiment like this one."
"We would like to hear from them, <i>personally</i>, if that is possible..."
"When can we talk to them? Perhaps something more... Like an interview while they are in the servers!"
Narrator::
The other news reporters stop whispering. All eyes lock on Cliff.
{fadeoutsound: smallgroupwhisper, 1} 
Cliff pauses for a few seconds, his face betraying no emotion.
Cliff::
"Well that is still up in the air. We must remain on high alert through this first test."
{additive: on}
"You see, we have to contend with a lot of unknowns.
The pressure of dealing with a whole new frontier will keep MC most likely distracted.
{if: n-b,false}
{
 It is <i>crucial</i> we keep him calm and safe. 
} 
{if: n-b,true}
{
 It is <i>crucial</i> we keep them calm and safe.
}
Regarding the information pertaining to this first experiment. For now, Digital Horizons has deemed this information to remain private."
{additive: off}
John::
<i>There it is. Something is up. If everything was peachy, they would be happy to share their results.</i>
Narrator::
{fadeinsound: smallgroupwhisper, 1}
The reporters raise their hands even higher, more urgent, as if they were grade school kids again. 
Cliff sighs visibly, a touch of irritability cracking his normally calm facade.
Cliff::
{additive:on}
"Look... 
We've already warned you prior to the conference that this is a very high risk experiment."
{additive: off}
"We understand the world wants to know more as it develops." 
"And we will endeavor to keep you informed." 
{if: n-b,false}
{
   {additive: on}
 "However,
 there is a young man's life at stake here, 
 and we want to be as careful as humanly possible. 
 After the conclusion of the first test, 
 and after Mr. MC has been cleared of quarantine, we will allow him to speak to the press."

}
Narrator::
With his final words spoken, Cliff waves goodbye to the press with an air of finality.
Cliff::
"We won't take any more questions at this time."
"You'll have to wait with the rest of the world."
Narrator::
{additive: on}
John feels something wrong as he watches Cliff motion to the lab techs to smoke the window. 
His fellow journalists just seem disappointed, as he would expect them to be.
Nothing out of the ordinary there.
{additive: off}
John taps his headset to turn on the mic.
John::
"You saw it yourself, Cindy. We wait."
Narrator::
No one seems to notice the sweat on Cliff's forehead as the window turns into a solid wall, blocking the truth out...
