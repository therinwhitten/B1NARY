Finally,
after what seems like an eternity, 
the MC's face goes completely flaccid.
It was hell watching the boy's panicked expression. 
{additive: off}
The eyes slowly close, peaceful now, devoid of any expression. 
{additive: on}
It seems almost anti-climatic as the hum of the digitizer just...
ceases,
the inert body limp on the seat.

As the press look on, cameras rolling, a team of medics with a cryotube slowly enter through the doorway with medical equipment, efficiently prepping the cryochamber.
{fadeinsound: Medic Stretcher, .1}
Inside the press room, the silence is palpable.
The press share glances, sip coffee, scribble down notes, as they wait impatiently for the announcement.
It felt like several hours to some, but time gels sometimes.
It really only takes about 30 seconds. And the lights in the lab room comes back on.
Medics grab the MC's inert body, carefully placing him into the cyrotube, applying sensors to the different sections of his body.
The limp body looks so dead. It unnerves the veteran journalist, John.
With a pneumatic swoosh, the stasis chamber closes with the MC inside. 
{fadeinsound: Cyrotube Close, .1}
{fadeinsound: Slow Heartbeat Machine, .1}
The stasis chamber looks like nothing John has ever seen before, displays, and touchscreen switches, covering the top of the lid.
You can hear the heart rate monitor, even the press room.
They really have pulled out all the stops for this project. Spared no expense.
Behind them, lab-techs at the laptops were calling over the Team Leader.
{fadeinsound: LeavingFootsteps, .1}
{additive: on}
John cannot follow the discussion happening, their lips are not in direct sight,
but careful discourse is happening.
{additive: off}
John smells a scoop.
As they continue the discussion, the medics remove the body, and the doors are shut tight. 
{fadeinsound: Door, 2}

Once the doors close, the clicking of a single laptop can be heard from one of the other reporters. 
Suddenly, the sound of Cindy's silky voice pops up in John's earpiece, startling him.
Cindy::
"John?"
{additive:on}
"Everything ok? 
We cut the feed to you until the announcement. 
And let me tell you, 
it is some great footage...... What is happening?"
{additive: off}
Narrator::
John cups one hand to his ear, activating the auto talk function.
John::
"Standy by Cindy. I think the Lead Lab Supervisor is about to speak."
Narrator::
He continues to observe closely. Something is different.
The Lab Supervisor, Cliff, is leaning over a lab tech's laptop, his back to the room. 
{additive: on}
As he asks questions,
you could see the tension stiffening his back.
John watches closely.
{additive: off}
{spawnChar: malesilo, -1, Cliff}
{moveChar: Cliff, .50}
Cliff stands up straight with confidence, turning to the press window.
With a dramatic clearing of his throat, he speaks, projecting his voice. 
{additive: on}
Cliff::
"To the denizens of Earth.
I can officially announce the successful transfer of MC into the digital realm."
{additive: off}
Narrator::
He pauses for affect, making eye contact with the press through the observation window, one by one.
When he observes them talking amongst themsevles, he continues, voice strong and steady.
Cliff::
{additive: on}
"We have confirmed his thought patterns in server 10.
His body is stable and in room temperature stasis in our medical lab." 
{additive: off}
"Tests are still being conducted to ensure he is aware of his location and fully cognizant." 
"I officially pronounce this experiment a resounding success!"
Narrator::
{fadeinsound: Press Conference, 1}
The symphony of camera shutters, and the flashing of lights, erupts as he makes his announcement to the world.
{additive: on}
That simple statement brings much excitement,
that ripples through the reporters like waves in a pond.
{additive: off}
John::
<i>What are you hiding, Cliff?</i>
Narrator::
The raising of hands, like a wave themselves, plead for Cliff's attention.  
Cliff points to one young reporter, a lady from another news channel.
Cliff::
"Yes? You there. Go ahead and ask your question."
Narrator::
She purses her lips, nervous.
Female Reporter::
"There are many concerns about the risks involved with an experiment like this one."
"We would like to hear from him, personally, if that is possible..."
"So, when will we be able to talk to him? Interview him in a digital environment?"
Narrator::
The other news reporters stop whispering. All eyes lock on Cliff. 
Cliff pauses for a few seconds, his face betraying no emotion.
Cliff::
"Well that is still up in the air. We must remain on high alert through this first test."
{additive: on}
"You see, we have to contend with a lot of unknowns.
The pressure of dealing with a whole new frontier will keep MC most likely distracted.
It is <i>crucial</i> we keep him calm and safe. 
So this first four-day test will be private."
{additive: off}
John::
<i>And there it is. Something is up. If everything was peachy, they would be happy to share their results.</i>
Narrator::
The reporters raise their hands even higher, more urgent, as if they were grade school kids again. 
Cliff sighs visibly, a touch of irritablilty cracking his normally calm facade.
Cliff::
{additive:on}
"Look... 
We have already have warned you prior to the conference that this is a very high risk experiment."
We understand the world wants to know more as it develops. 
And we will endevour to keep you informed."
{additive: off}
{additive: on}
"However,
there is a young man's life at stake here, 
and we want to be as careful as humanly possible. 
After the conclusion of the first test, 
and after Mr. MC has been cleared of quarantine, we will allow him to speak to the press."
{additive: off}
Narrator::
And with that, he waves goodbye to the press with an air of finality. 
Cliff::
"We won't take any more questions at this time."
"You will have to wait with the rest of the world ok?"
Narrator::
{additive: on}
John feels something wrong as he watches Cliff motion to the lab techs to smoke the window. 
His fellow journalists just seem disappointed, as he would expect them to be.
Nothing out of the ordinary there.
{additive: off}
John taps his headset to turn on the mic.
John::
"You saw it yourself, Cindy. We wait."
Narrator::
No one seems to notice the sweat on Cliff's forehead as the window turns into a solid wall, blocking the truth out......
