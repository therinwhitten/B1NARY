MC::
My mind becomes one peice again in a violent snap, like a rubber band stretching too taut. 
I am suddenly me again, muscle spasms and tingling all over. 
I gasp for air.
Ground? I am lying on the ground?
The vegetation is moist to my back, soaking my shirt. 
Not having a body really puts you in a panic.
At least it's not cold. 
The ringing fades, and I touch my chest thankfully. 
"What a ride."
My voice sounds strange, foreign. Even to me. 
{additive: on}
Is this... 
a part of the simulation they had planned for me?
{additive: off}
I stare up a very clear night sky, the stars numerous. 
I have never seen a sky this clear, and this devoid of light pollution. 
Like a sheet stretched thin, and punctured with holes to allow the light through.
My chuckle sounds a bit hoarse, but I manage to get it out. 
Imagine: I have to go to the digital world to see nature. 
How Ironic...
Cramping easing, I try, very slowly, to sit up. 
There is the nausea....
I give myself about 20 seconds, then push the rest of the way up. 
Sitting on the damp ground I look around.
A warm breeze buffets my body. It pebbles my bare skin.
I shiver. I have to stand up. 
..........
My butt is getting wet.
Sighing, I roll over just enough to stand up. 
Surprisingly, it feels real enough. 
Groaning, I get myself to my feet. 
WOW....
Wait...what?
Is that a...manor????
I blink slowly, figuring it is my eyes playing tricks on me. 
I look again.
Nope, it is definitely a manor.
And the moon. So big you can touch it. 
I reach my hand out...
And can't encapsulate the moon. 
And that manor....
The server was supposed to be a clean environment. 
That looks like an old manor of some romanian diplomat.

Who the FUCK are you?"

"I come out to find some loser sneaking about?"
MC::
With inhuman speed, this..... demon, comes flying out of the treeline.
{additive:on}
Like a rocket, 
he comes flying, 
planting his feet, 
not two feet in front of me.
{additive:off}
The wind of his movement smacks me directly in the face. 
He is not human, he may be wearing normal clothes but...
The way he moves, is inhuman. 
He stands before me, his mask like an extension of his face. 
Like it IS his face. His mask even blinks.
An eerie green glow pulses from under his hood. 
No, this is NOT the server.
I am somewhere else, or this is a bad dream. 
My body still recuperating, I can only remain silent, and watch.
I can't move..... I am
SCARED. 
To much to process. 
WHO IS THIS????
Masked Punk::
"Hey......shithead, I asked you a question!"
MC:: 
I swallow.
"Name is MC, I just got here."
"Nice to meet you??"
NO way I can run. He is too fast. 
He looks...very violent. 
There is nothing else I can do. 
{additive:on}
Either run, 
and get beat down.
Or stand, 
and get beat down.
{additive:off}
I need to show I am not a threat. 
<i>Not hard to do.</i>  
So, the only thing I could do....was offer my hand. 
"I was teleported here. I didn't mean to encroach on your property."
He looks at my hand, pausing, as if waiting for something.
Masked Punk::
"Encroach? What the fuck? What does that mean?!"
"Are you insulting me?!"
MC:: 
Oh shit...
"No No! It means trespass!"
I wave my hands in denial.
"Trust me, there is no reason to insult you."
Please don't smash me like a bug. 
Masked Punk::
"Huh? Well....."
He pauses. 
He looks down at my hand, and takes it. 
"In that case, name is Szycrotic."
Szycrotic:: 
{changeName: Masked Punk, Szycrotic}
MC::
As he grabs my hand, he pulls me close.
The mask is almost touching my nose. 
I swallow with careful deliberation.
This close up, the smell of sulfur fills my nostrils. 
Szycrotic::
"If you hurt this realm, or my Lord, I will cut you MANY times..."
He pauses and smiles with only his mask, green, glowing smoke, leaking out.
"Many times....."
MC::
When the hand shake starts to get unbearably uncomfortable, he suddenly pushes me back. 
He turns and starts walking to the manor, hand in pocket.
After a few steps, he stops, his head pivoting a little too far for a human.
His gaze pierces right through me. 
Szycrotic::
"It wasn't a request. You WILL come with me." 
"Lord Asterella will figure out what to do with you."
"You are <i>Encroaching</i> after all."
MC::
I only have a few seconds of reaction here. 
The dude is fast. 
If I go with him, this "Lord" may skewer me. 
Then again, I might be able to dodge him enough and get into the forest. 
{choice: What should I do? Don't get me killed player.}
 {
    Are you crazy? Run!
    [
       Ok, here goes nothing!
       {changeScript: Male/Prologue/Star I A}
    ]
    Caution. Can you die in the digital realm?
    [
       I don't think it's wise to anger a demon. I am alive, for now. 
    ]
 }
"Lead the way."
Nothing to do but hope I don't get killed. 
Or worse, tortured. This "guy" seems to be the type to enjoy pain.
