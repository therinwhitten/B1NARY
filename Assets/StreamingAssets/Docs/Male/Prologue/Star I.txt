MC::
My mind becomes one piece again in a violent snap, like a rubber band stretching too taut. 
I am suddenly me again, muscle spasms and tingling all over. 
I gasp for air.
<i>(huff)</i> "Holy shit" <i>(phoo)</i> "that was a hell of a ride..."
Ground? I am lying on the ground?
The vegetation is moist to my back, soaking my shirt. 
I <i>feel</i> the moisture.
Not having a body really puts you in a panic.
It's not even cold. 
The ringing fades, and I touch my chest thankfully. 
"What a ride."
My voice sounds strange, foreign. Even to me. 
{additive: on}
Is this... 
a part of the simulation they had planned for me?
{additive: off}
I stare up a very clear night sky, the stars numerous.
It's...beautiful! 
I have never seen a sky this clear, and this devoid of light pollution. 
Like a sheet stretched thin, and punctured with holes to allow the light through.
My chuckle sounds a bit hoarse, but I manage to get it out. 
Imagine: I have to go to the digital world to see nature. 
The irony is hilariously on point.
Cramping easing, I try, very slowly, to sit up. 
There is the nausea... Back with a vengence. 
This time, it has a body attached to it. 
I give myself about 20 seconds, then push the rest of the way up. 
Sitting on the damp ground I look around.
A warm breeze buffets my body. It pebbles my bare skin.
I shiver. I have to stand up. 
...
My butt is getting wet.
Sighing, I roll over just enough to stand up. 
Surprisingly, it feels real enough. 
Groaning, I get myself to my feet, all the muscles in my body protesting vehemently.
WOW...
Wait...what?
Is that a...mansion?
I blink slowly, figuring it is my eyes playing tricks on me. 
I look again.
Nope, it is definitely a manor.
And the moon. So big you can touch it. 
I reach my hand out...
And encapsulate the moon with my hand.
And that manor...
The server was supposed to be a clean environment. 
That looks like a manor of some Romanian diplomat.
Masked Punk::
{additive: on}
"What the fuck?
And who the <i>fuck</i> are you?"

{fadeinsound: Szy Dark, 3}

{moveChar: Masked Punk, .50}
"I come here to find some loser sneaking about?"
MC::
With inhuman speed, this...demon, comes flying out of the tree line.
{additive:on}
Like a rocket, 
he appears, 
planting his feet, 
not two feet in front of me.
{additive:off}
The wind of his movement buffets my face. 
He is not human, he may be wearing normal clothes but...
He stands before me, his mask like an extension of his face. 
Like it <i>is</i> his face. His mask even blinks.
An eerie green glow pulses from under his hood. 
No, this is <i>not</i> the server I was meant to land in.
I am somewhere else, or this is a bad dream. 
My body still recuperating, I can only remain silent, and watch.
I can't move... I am
<i>scared</i>.
This is simply too much to process. 
<i>Who is this?!</i>
Masked Punk::
"Hey...shithead, I distinctly remember asking you a question."
MC:: 
"Name is MC. Um...hi? I just got here."
I swallow.
"Nice to meet you??"
I left it an open-ended question.
There is <i>no</i> way I can run. He is too fast. 
He looks...capable of instant violence. 
There is nothing else I can do. 
{additive:on}
Either run, 
and get beat down.
{additive:off}
{additive:on}
Or stand, 
and get beat down.
{additive:off}
I need to show I am not a threat. 
<i>Not hard to do.</i>  
So, the only thing I can do...is offer my hand.
Stay calm MC. 
"I was teleported here. I didn't mean to encroach on your property."
He looks at my hand, pausing, as if waiting for something.
It feels like a couple of seconds before his mask lights up in annoyance.
Masked Punk::
"Encroach? What the fuck?" 
"What does that mean?"
"Are you insulting me?!"
MC:: 
Oh shit...
"No No! It means trespass!"
I wave my hands in denial.
"Trust me, there is no reason to insult you."
Please don't smash me like a bug. I don't smash well. 
Masked Punk::
The slits of his eyes narrow suspiciously.
"Huh? Well..."
He pauses. 
He looks down at my hand, and takes it. 
{changeName: Masked Punk, Szycrotic}
Szycrotic:: 
"In that case, name is Szycrotic."
MC::
Whew!
He grabs my hand, pulling me close in one motion.
The mask is almost touching my nose. 
I swallow with careful deliberation.
This close up, the smell of sulfur fills my nostrils. 
Szycrotic::
"If you hurt this realm, I will cut you <i>many</i> times..."
He grins, his mask, glowing, with green smoke leaking out.
"Many times....."
MC::
When the hand shake starts to get unbearably uncomfortable, he suddenly pushes me back. 
My arm hits my chest, and I adjust to keep balance, taking a step back.
There was no effort on his part. 
He is insanely strong.
He turns and starts walking to the manor, hand in pocket.
After a few steps, he stops, his head pivoting a little too far for a human.
His gaze pierces right through me. 
Szycrotic::
"It wasn't a request. You <i>will</i> come with me." 
"Star will figure out what to do with you."
"You are <i>encroaching</i> after all."
MC::
I only have a few seconds of reaction here. 
The dude is fast. 
If I go with him, this "Star" may skewer me. 
Then again, I might be able to dodge him enough and get into the forest. 
We have about 10 feet of distance between us. I <i>might</i> just be able to get to full speed.
{choice: What should I do? Don't get me killed player.}
 {
    Are you stupid? Run!
    [
       Ok, here goes nothing!

       {moveChar: Szycrotic, -1}
       MC::
       {fadeinsound: footsteps run forest, .5}
       Off through the trees and tall grass I run, forcing my pace to widen.
       My body immediately protests loudly at the sudden movement. 
       Groans escape my clenching teeth. 
       This was a bad idea.
       This was an <i>incredibly</i> bad idea.
       My body, not exactly prime-fitness material to begin with, is still reeling from the teleportation.
       Running almost fast enough to fall forward, I lose balance momentarily.....
       {fadeinsound: body punch hard, 1}
       OUCH!
       My leg hits a branch, the thump hard enough to be audible. I almost fall on my face...
       I feel a hand, solid as iron, grasp my shoulder. 
       {moveChar: Szycrotic, .5}
       Szycrotic::
       "You want to do this the hard way eh?"
       "Haha very well."
       MC::
       "I panicked ok?! I beg you! Don't cut me!"
       Szycrotic::
       His mask takes on a look of confusion.
       "What are you stupid? I won't cut you."
       "Not yet."
       "No seriously, you haven't hurt this realm bro. Just yourself."
       "Your leg is bleeding bro. Look."
       MC::
       I look down, and see a small bit of blood oozing through my pants. 
       By the time I notice the blood, the throbbing pain catches up to my brain. 
       I groan a bit, a sharp intake of breath coming after. 
       Szycrotic laughs behind me.
       Szycrotic::
       **TODO: Make henable**
       if: henabled, true
       "I haven't stuck anything in you yet, Daddy."
       if: henable, false
       "Calm down bro. Just gonna tie you up. Can't have Star blaming me for your injuries, now can we?"
       MC::
       Suddenly, I feel iron grips grabbing my wrists. 
       For a second, I try to fight, but there is no stopping him. 
       His strength far exceeds mine. 
       I give up, and soon enough, ropes are around my wrists behind my back. 
       {additive: on}
       Szycrotic moves around to face me, 
       studying me. 
       {additive: off}
       Although, with his mask, it is kind of hard to read his expressions.
       Not this time though...
       His mask cracks in a smile. 
       Szycrotic::
       "One more rope should suffice."
       MC::
       He places a rope around my neck, securing it with just enough room to breath.
       Szycrotic::
       "Oh, this is fun! I am <i>glad</i> you ran."
       MC::
       {additive: on}
       I say nothing. I am tethered like a stray dog.
       I do the only thing I am capable of doing: I scowl.
       Inside of five minutes in the digital realm, I am already a prisoner.
       {additive:off}
       Szycrotic turns around, satisfied with his handiwork.
       Szycrotic::
       "Ok boy. Les goooo!"
       MC::
       "It's not 'boy.' It's MC."
       He tugs on the rope, and I follow grudingly.
       Szycrotic::
       "You got some balls man, all tied up like that. Ok <i>MC</i>."
       "We will see if those balls will stay after meeting Star."
       {moveChar: Szycrotic, .15}
       {fadeinsound: walkingongravel, 1}
       {fadeinsound: Star Piano, 4}
       {fadeoutsound: Szy Dark, 3}
       MC::
       That name tickles my memory.
       Asterella....Star?
       It hits me like a truck. 
       "Asterella Star? I <i>do</i> know that name."
       As we walk, he grunts appreciatively.
       Szycrotic::
       "Pretty calm for being tied up. Yes, Asterella Star."
       "You seem to know her at least. Be sure to show her proper respect. She is a busy woman."
       MC::
       Asterella Star: A V-Tuber know as the Demon Lord of the 69th Circle of Hell. 
       She is just a streamer though.....
       And Szycrotic, that name might actually be a streamer's as well. 
       The name is very familiar.
       Yet, a streamer doesn't move like a damn demon either. 
       Am I on Twatch??
       No fucking way.
       No way.
       "Hey Szycrotic?"
       Szycrotic::
       "Yeah?"
       MC::
       "Are we actually in the 69th Circle of Hell?"
       He laughs. 
       The shadows concealed how very well built the path we were on is. 
       Old stone, hewn by hand, and worn over a very long time. It is almost like pavement.
       Szycrotic:: 
       "Where else would we be? Of coarse we are!"
       MC:: 
       He lets out a breath, audible to even me. 
       "Look, you did this to yourself, man. No one comes here without her express permission."
       "And yet, somehow, some weak ass punk, was able to just waltz in here."
       Szycrotic shakes his head in disbelief.
       {moveChar: Szycrotic, .50}
       {fadeoutsound: walkingongravel, 1}
       MC::
       He stops for a second, and studies me for a moment. 
       Szycrotic::
       "You know, it's possible you are <i>pretending</i> to be weak and just into this shit."
       MC::
       The smile is bigger, like he <i>wants</i> that to be the truth. 
       "Seriously, who likes to be tied up and manhandled like a sack of potatoes?"
       I mumble this in defiance a bit. 
       Szycrotic::
       "Hurt Me Daddy...OH!"
       He laughs as he jerks the rope and starts moving again.
       {fadeinsound: walkingongravel, 1}
       {moveChar: Szycrotic, .15}
       MC::
       I have no control over my situation. 
       And I know of Asterella Star. In fact, I have watched many of her streams in the past. 
       If she is really here, then maybe I can get some help.
       I feel myself frown a bit. 
       Yet......Szycrotic doesn't seem like he is roleplaying at all.
       He thinks he <i>is</i> a demon. 
       Will Star be the same way?
       I feel a jerk on my ropes, the knot digging into my wrists a bit. 
       It almost pulls me off balance, and I instinctively adjust against it. 
       Szycrotic::
       "We are wasting time. Speed up! No dragging your heels..."
       {fadeoutsound: Szy Dark, 5}
       {fadeinsound: walkingongravel, 1}
       MC::
       We trudge closer to the manor, step by step.
       I have never been tied like this before. 
       I almost...<i>almost</i> chuckle at my situation.
       As we near the huge mansion, I realize that this isn't just a manor in the woods. 
       There is a whole complex, with multiple buildings surrounding it.
       We pass the threshold of the outer wall, and my eyes take in the elegant beauty. 
       The lawn is too large to be called a lawn. 
       Spread out across it are very carefully placed oaks, and ash, with small sitting spots and flowerbeds. 
       {fadeinsound: waterfountain, 2}
       Black, marble benches, are set in a mathmatically pleasing way, down the main walkthroughs. 
       I still have to mainstain speed, so I try to soak in more. 
       Like the massive waist deep fountain directly center of the main doors into the the Manor proper.
       {fadeoutsound: waterfountain, 4} 
       {fadeoutsound: walkingongravel, 1}
       {fadeoutsound: Star Piano, 3}
       {moveChar: Szycrotic, .50}
       We stop in front of the 10 foot tall, ancient wooden doors. 
       Szycrotic::
       "I noticed you admiring the grounds. You think <i>that</i> is beautiful, wait until you go inside."
       MC::
       He pulls on the handle.
       {fadeinsound: castle door, 1}
       Szycrotic::
       "Better yet, wait until you meet Her."
       MC::
       We go into the largest mansion I have ever seen...
       {changeScript: Male/Prologue/Star II}
    ]
    Did you forget how he <i>appeared</i> in front of you? 
    [
       I don't think it's wise to anger a demon. I am alive, for now. 
    ]
 }
"Lead the way."
Nothing to do, but hope I don't get killed. 
Or worse, tortured. This "guy" seems to be the type to enjoy pain.
For a brief second, disappointment flashes across his mask.
Szycrotic turns around and starts walking. 
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .2}
{fadeinsound: walkingongravel, 1}
{fadeoutsound: Szy Dark, 5}
{fadeinsound: Star Piano, 5}
Szycrotic looks over his shoulder to make sure I am still following. 
Szycrotic::
"You know, you are lucky Star felt you before I did."
"I don't generally tolerate 'uninvited guests' as well as she does."
"Where did you come from?"
MC::
Play it safe, for now. 
"I just ended up here by accident. I can't really go into detail."
The name is tickling my memory, but I can't quite place it.....
I shake my head.
{additive:on}
Safe and true. 
I mean, who would believe me?
{additive: off}
I almost walk beside him. I mean there is only one path.
MC::
"Asterella Star? Is that who is in charge here?"
Szycrotic nods approvingly, glancing sideways at me, reassessing me.
Szycrotic::
"Yes. You seem to know her. Are you a Demon Lord? Or..."
MC::
The disbelief dominates his expression.
It hurts a bit, not going to lie. 
I can't say I watched her streams. That skirts way too close to the actual truth. 
I have a feeling he might catch me in a lie as well. 
"I know <i>of</i> her through friends. I hear she is very beautiful."
"And...do I look like a demon lord to you?"
Szycrotic chuckles.
Szycrotic::
"Yeah. I didn't think so. No offense but..."
"Just wait until you meet her. She is beyond just beautiful."
MC::
He pauses, kicking a rock off the path as he thinks.
Szycrotic::
{additive:on}
"She is like...the sexiest demon lord ever.
Only one other matches her, and she is fucking Satan, yo."
{additive:off}
MC::
He laughs openly.
Szycrotic::
{additive: on}
"They both disagree often. 
Ironmouse and Star are like sisters."
{additive: off}
MC::
Wait Ironmouse too?
What did I walk into? This brings up so many questions...
Maybe they are just roleplaying? A live stream event?
"Are you saying IronMouse is in charge of all the Demon Lords in Hell?"
"And...Asterella Star is one of them?"
Szycrotic::
"That's what I said, MC."
"But...Ironmouse doesn't take her job that serious man." 
MC::
I can hear frustration in his tone. 
I can't help but just stare down the path at the outer wall.
This is crazy! Are they not human streamers?
The demon looks back at me with an amused glance.
Szycrotic::
{additive: on}
"And Star doesn't approve.
Star treats Mouse like she is the younger sister, 
running off and playing instead of being responsible."
{additive: off}
"The sparks that sometime's fly between those two...you can't help but grab some popcorn and watch."
MC::
I mull over this.
"So where is this place? That I accidentally fell into?"
In front of us, an outer wall looms, hewn of ancient stone.
Vegetation grows in the cracks and crevices. 
Szycrotic waves a hand, and the main gates open.
Szycrotic::
"Welcome to the center of the 69th Circle of Hell, MC."
MC::
{additive:on}
We pass through the entrance in silence. 
I feel like he is giving me a chance to soak in the sights of the inner courtyard.
{additive:off}
And it is extensive...
{additive:on}
Yard?
Hardly. 
It is a too big to be anything but a field.
{fadeinsound: waterfountain, 5}
{additive:off} 
Spread out across it are meticulous placed oaks, and ash, with small sitting spots and flowerbeds. 
Black, marble benches, are set in a mathmatically pleasing way, down the main walkthroughs. 
I still have to maintain speed, so I try to soak in more. 
{fadeoutsound: waterfountain, 5}
Like the <i>enormous,</i> waist deep, fountain directly center of the main doors into the the Manor proper. 
{fadeoutsound: walkingongravel, 1}
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .50}
We stop in front of the 10-foot tall, ancient wooden doors.

He pulls on the handle.
{fadeinsound: castle door, 1}
{fadeoutsound: Wind Heavy, 2}
{fadeoutsound: Star Piano, 2} 
Szycrotic::
"Better yet, wait until you meet Her."

{moveChar: Szycrotic, .25}
MC::
It took at least 5 mins of walking to get here. 
The mansion is almost a small village by itself, with many different rooms.
I lost count at 50 people in the short time I was counting.
Alot of them were not human. Some had horns, tails, and scales.
Some cat girls too.
MC::
Mah Heart! 
And...
Szycrotic has been humming songs under his breath the entire way. 
I don't recognize the tune at all. It's alien to me.
{moveChar: Asterella, .75}
{additive: on}
As we come in, 
a stunning, young lady, 
reading a book on the couch,
looks up at us as we enter.

Those black and lavendar eyes. 
This was surely Asterella Star. 
{additive: off}
{additive: on}
The transparent, orchid silk material, shifts suggestively, 
hugging her form in a very...sensual way.
{additive: off} 
Seeing her in person, with no screen. No barriers....
{fadeinsound: Heart Thump, .1}
My heart thumps in response. 
Szycrotic::
"Hey Star, I'm back! I bring forth the intruder, as requested..."
MC::
He bows deeply, in a very formal manner. 
{additive:on}
Huh. Honestly....it surprises me. 
I did not see that capability of polish to be in him.
{additive:off}
It brings it's own problems though. 
Asterella Star is a Demon Lord, in charge of a realm.
Whether or not I believe it to be genuine. <i>They do.</i>
I remain silent.
Szycrotic::
"Was that good? I feel like that was good."
MC::
Still in mid bow, he looks back at me for support.....
I shrug...confused. 
Star's light chuckle locks her identity down. 
MC::
"Do I look like an expert on etiquette?"
I get a very satisfying scowl.
Asterella::
"Szy...that wasn't too bad, actually."
"Don't...do that again, though. It freaks me out when you do it."
MC::
The welcome surprise in her voice reflects mine.
She closes the book with an air of finality, placing it on the table.
For the first time since entering the room, she looks at both of us.
With one smooth motion, she is standing.
I stay in the half bow position with Szy.
The voice confirmed it. This is the Asterella Star from Twatch.
I know that voice all too well. Her streams are hilariously cursed at times. 
And her audience loves it. 
Szycrotic::
"Not bad huh? Do I get my reward then, woman?"
MC::
The blank look from Asterella was priceless.
Asterella::
"Ok stop bowing... From you, that looks pretty silly."
MC::
A slight turn of her lips suggests a smile.
Asterella::
"And almost sarcastic."
MC::
She motions at me, looking at me for the first time.
Asterella::
"He is a pretty cute elven boy."
{additive:on}
"You can call me Star. 
There is no need for formality in here. 
Tell me, what is your name?"
{additive:off}
MC:: 
"Name is MC, it is a pleasure to meet you."
Asterella::
"What a lovely name. MC."
MC::
She turns to Szycrotic.
Asterella::
"Yes, you may be rewarded."
"Go, see the Dungeon Master for your nightly punishment."
"I will attend to this...intruder."
MC::
Nightly...punishment???
Oh oh. 
What did I drag myself into?
Up close, the whole experience is surreal.
{additive: on} 
This is not some V-Tuber stream.
They seem to <i>live</i> here.
