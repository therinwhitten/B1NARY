My mind becomes one piece again in a violent snap, like a rubber band stretching too taut..
I'm suddenly me again, muscle spasms and tingling all over. 
I gasp for air.
<i>(huff)</i> "Holy shit" <i>(phoo)</i> 
Ground? I'm lying on the ground?
The vegetation is moist to my back, soaking my shirt. 
I <i>feel</i> the moisture.
Not having a body really puts you in a panic.
It's not even cold. 
The ringing fades, and I touch my chest thankfully. 
"What a ride."
My voice sounds strange. Foreign, even to me. 
{additive: on}
Is this... 
a part of the simulation they had planned for me?
{additive: off}
I stare up a clear night sky, the stars numerous.
It's beautiful! 
I have never seen a sky this clear, and this devoid of light pollution. 
Like a sheet stretched thin and punctured with holes to allow the light through.
My chuckle sounds a bit hoarse, but I manage to get it out. 
Who knew Iâ€™d have to go to the digital world to see nature? 
The irony is hilariously on point.
My cramps easing, I slowly sit up.
There's the nausea, back with a vengeance. 
This time though, it has a body attached to it. 
I give myself about 20 seconds, then push the rest of the way up. 
Sitting on the damp ground I look around.
A warm breeze buffets my body. It pebbles my bare skin.
I shiver. I have to stand up. 
...
My butt is getting wet.
Sighing, I roll over just enough to stand up. 
Surprisingly, it feels real enough. 
Groaning, I get myself to my feet, all the muscles in my body protesting vehemently.
WOW.
Wait...what?
Is that a mansion?
I blink slowly, figuring it's my eyes playing tricks on me. 
I look again.
Nope, it is definitely a manor.
And the moon. So big you can touch it. 
I reach my hand out.
And encapsulate the moon with my hand.
This place is unreal. The moon dwarfs anything I have ever seen in the sky.
The server was supposed to be a clean environment. 
And yet, a Romanian manor stands tall, bathed in the bright moonlight.

With inhuman speed, this demon comes flying out of the tree line.
{additive:on}
Like a rocket, 
he appears, 
planting his feet, 
not two feet in front of me.
{additive:off}
The wind of his movement buffets my face. 
He's not human. He may be wearing normal clothes but...
He stands before me, his mask like an extension of his face. 
Like it <i>is</i> his face. His mask even blinks.
An eerie blue glow pulses from under his hood. 
No, this is <i>not</i> the server I was meant to land in.
I am either somewhere else, or this is a bad dream. 
My body still recuperating, I can only remain silent and watch.
I can't move.
<i>I'm scared.</i>.
This is simply too much to process. 
<i>Who is this?!</i>
Masked Punk::
"Hey. Shithead... I distinctly remember asking you a question."
{anim: Masked Punk, Wind Idle}

MC:: 
"My name is MC. Um...hi? I just got here."
I swallow.
"Nice to meet you?"
I left it an open-ended question.
There is <i>no</i> way I can run. He's too fast. 
And capable of instant violence. 
There is nothing I can do. 
{additive:on}
Either run, 
and get beat down.
{additive:off}
{additive:on}
Or stand,

I need to show I'm not a threat. 
<i>Not hard to do.</i>  
So, the only thing I can do is offer my hand.

Stay calm MC. 
"I was teleported here. I didn't mean to encroach on your property."
Masked Punk::

He looks at my hand, pausing, as if waiting for something.
It feels like a couple of seconds before his mask lights up in annoyance.
Masked Punk::

[Angry]
"Encroach? What the fuck?" 
"What does that even mean?"
"Are you fucking insulting me?!"
MC:: 
Oh shit.
"No. No. No. It means trespass!"
I wave my hand in denial.
"Trust me, there is no reason to insult you."
Please don't smash me like a bug. I don't smash well. 
The slits of his eyes narrow suspiciously.
Masked Punk::
"Huh? Well..."
[Default]
MC::
He pauses.
{movecube: .5, 0} 
He looks down at my hand and takes it. 
{changeName: Masked Punk, Lucas}
Lucas:: 
"In that case, name's Lucas."
MC::
Whew!
He grabs my hand, pulling me close in one motion.
The mask is almost touching my nose. 
I swallow with careful deliberation.
{fadeinsound: no_one_expects_whisper, .1}
{setachievement: second_swallow}
This close up, the smell of sulfur fills my nostrils. 
Lucas::
"If you hurt this realm, I'll cut you like a pig. Got it?"
MC::
He grins, his mask, glowing, with blue smoke leaking out.
When the handshake starts to get unbearably uncomfortable, he suddenly pushes me back. 
My arm hits my chest, and I adjust to keep balance, taking a step back.
There was no effort on his part. 
He is insanely strong.
He turns and starts walking to the manor, hand in pocket.
After a few steps, he stops, his head pivoting a little too far for a human.
His gaze pierces right through me. 
Lucas::
{anim: Lucas, Impatient End}
"It wasn't a request. You <i>will</i> come with me." 
"Star will figure out what to do with you."
"You are <i>encroaching</i> after all."
MC::
I only have a few seconds of reaction here. 
The dude is fast. 
If I go with him, this "Star" may skewer me. 
Then again, I might be able to dodge him enough and get into the forest. 
We have about 10 feet of distance between us. I <i>might</i> just be able to get to full speed.

       Grunts escape my clenching teeth. 
       {disablechar: CircleWipe}
       This was a bad idea.
       This was an <i>incredibly</i> bad idea.
       My body, not exactly prime-fitness material to begin with, is still reeling from the teleportation.
       Running almost fast enough to fall forward, I lose balance momentarily.
       {fadeinsound: body punch hard, 1}
       OUCH!
       My leg hits a branch, the thump hard enough to be audible. I almost fall on my face.
       I feel a hand, solid as iron, grasp my shoulder.

       "Well. Not yet."
       "No seriously, you haven't hurt this realm at all."
       "Bro, take a look at yourself, your leg is bleeding."
       MC::
       I look down, and see a small bit of blood oozing through my pants. 
       By the time I notice the blood, the throbbing pain catches up to my brain. 
       I groan a bit, a sharp intake of breath coming after. 
       Lucas laughs behind me.

       MC::
       Suddenly, I feel iron grips grabbing my wrists. 
       For a second, I try to fight, but there is no stopping him. 
       His strength far exceeds mine. 
       I give up, and soon enough, ropes are around my wrists behind my back. 
       {additive: on}
       Lucas moves around to face me, 
       studying me. 
       {additive: off}
       Although, with his mask, it is kind of hard to read his expressions.
       Not this time though.
       His mask cracks in a smile.

       Lucas::

       "And one more rope should work... And another rope, and another rope, and another rope."
       "Oooh that kinda turns me on a bit."
       MC::
       He places a rope around my neck, securing it with just enough room to breathe.
       Lucas::
       "Oh, this is fun! I'm <i>glad</i> you ran."

       It hits me like a truck. 
       "Asterella Star? I <i>do</i> know that name."
       As we walk, he grunts appreciatively.
       Lucas::
       "Pretty calm for being tied up. Yes, Asterella Star."
       "You seem to know her at least. Be sure to show her proper fucking respect. She's a busy woman."
       MC::
       Asterella Star: A V-Tuber known as the Demon Lord of the 69th Circle of Hell. 
       She is just a streamer though.
       And Lucas, that name might actually be a streamer's as well. 
       The name is very familiar.
       Yet, a streamer doesn't move like a damn demon either. 
       Am I on Twatch??
       No fucking way.
       No way.
       "Hey Lucas!"

       {fadeinsound: Lucas Laugh 4, .2}
       He laughs. 
       The shadows concealed how very well built the path we were on is. 
       Old stone, hewn by hand, and worn over a very long time. It is almost like pavement.
       Lucas:: 
       "Where else would we be? Of course we are!"
       MC:: 
       He lets out a breath, audible to even me. 
       Lucas::
       "Look, you did this to yourself. Nobody comes here without her express permission."

       "You know, it's possible you are <i>pretending</i> to be weak and just into this shit."
       MC::
       The smile is bigger, like he <i>wants</i> that to be true. 
       "Seriously, who likes to be tied up and manhandled like a sack of potatoes?"
       I mumble this in defiance a bit.

       He laughs as he jerks the rope and starts moving again.
       I have no control over my situation. 
       I know of Asterella Star. In fact, I have watched many of her streams in the past. 
       If she is really here, then maybe I can get some help.
       I feel myself frown a bit. 
       Yet Lucas doesn't seem like he is roleplaying at all.
       He thinks he <i>is</i> a demon. 
       Will Star be the same way?
       I feel a jerk on my ropes, the knot digging into my wrists a bit. 
       It almost pulls me off balance, and I instinctively adjust against it. 
       Lucas::
       "We are wasting time. Speed up! No dragging your heels."

       {fadeinsound: Walking on Gravel, 1}
       MC::
       We trudge closer to the manor, step by step.
       I've never been tied like this before. 
       I almost...<i>almost</i> chuckle at my situation.
       As we near the huge mansion, I realize that this isn't just a manor in the woods. 
       This is a whole complex with multiple buildings surrounding it.
       We pass the threshold of the outer wall, and my eyes take in an elegant beauty. 
       The lawn is too large to be called a lawn. 
       Spread out across it are very carefully placed oaks, and ash, with small sitting spots and flowerbeds. 
       {fadeinsound: waterfountainstar, 2}
       Black marble benches are set in a mathematically pleasing way, down the main walkthroughs. 
       I still have to maintain speed, so I try to soak in more. 
       Like the massive, waist deep fountain directly center of the main doors into the the manor proper.

"Lead the way."
Nothing to do but hope I don't get killed. 
Or worse, tortured. This "guy" seems to be the type to enjoy pain.
For a brief second, disappointment flashes across his mask.

"I don't generally tolerate 'uninvited guests' as well as she does."
"Where did you even come from?"

<i>Play it safe for now.</i>

The name is tickling my memory, but I can't quite place it...

I almost walk beside him. I mean there is only one path.

"Asterella Star? Is that who is in charge here?"
Lucas nods approvingly, glancing sideways at me, reassessing me.
Lucas::
"Yes. You seem to know her. Are you a Demon Lord? Or..."
MC::
The disbelief dominates his expression.
It hurts a bit, not going to lie. 
I can't say I watched her streams. That skirts way too close to the actual truth. 
I have a feeling he might catch me in a lie as well. 
"I know <i>of</i>  her through friends. I hear she is very beautiful."
"And do I look like a demon lord to you?"
{fadeinsound: Lucas Laugh 4, .1}
Lucas chuckles.
Lucas::
"Yeah. I didn't think so. No offense but..."
"Just wait until you meet her. She is beyond beautiful."

He pauses, kicking a rock off the path as he thinks.
Lucas::
"Bruh, she's like, the sexiest demon lord ever."
MC::
He laughs openly.
MC::
What did I walk into? This brings up so many questions.
Maybe they are just roleplaying? A live stream event?
I can't help but just stare down the path at the outer wall.
This is crazy! Are they not human streamers?
The demon looks back at me with an amused glance.
Lucas::

MC::
I mull over this.
"So where is this place that I accidentally fell into?"
In front of us, an outer wall looms, hewn of ancient stone.
Vegetation grows in the cracks and crevices.

A lot of them were not human. Some had horns, tails, and scales.
Some cat girls too.

Asterella Star is a Demon Lord in charge of a realm.
Whether or not I believe it to be genuine. <i>They do.</i>
I remain silent.

For the first time since entering the room, she looks at both of us.
In one smooth motion she is standing.
I stay in the half bow position with Lucas.
