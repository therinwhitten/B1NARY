MC::
My mind becomes one peice again in a violent snap, like a rubber band stretching too taut. 
I am suddenly me again, muscle spasms and tingling all over. 
I gasp for air.
Ground? I am lying on the ground?
The vegetation is moist to my back, soaking my shirt. 
Not having a body really puts you in a panic.
At least it's not cold. 
The ringing fades, and I touch my chest thankfully. 
"What a ride."
My voice sounds strange, foreign. Even to me. 
{additive: on}
Is this... 
a part of the simulation they had planned for me?
{additive: off}
I stare up a very clear night sky, the stars numerous. 
I have never seen a sky this clear, and this devoid of light pollution. 
Like a sheet stretched thin, and punctured with holes to allow the light through.
My chuckle sounds a bit hoarse, but I manage to get it out. 
Imagine: I have to go to the digital world to see nature. 
How Ironic...
Cramping easing, I try, very slowly, to sit up. 
There is the nausea....
I give myself about 20 seconds, then push the rest of the way up. 
Sitting on the damp ground I look around.
A warm breeze buffets my body. It pebbles my bare skin.
I shiver. I have to stand up. 
..........
My butt is getting wet.
Sighing, I roll over just enough to stand up. 
Surprisingly, it feels real enough. 
Groaning, I get myself to my feet. 
WOW....
Wait...what?
Is that a...manor????
I blink slowly, figuring it is my eyes playing tricks on me. 
I look again.
Nope, it is definitely a manor.
And the moon. So big you can touch it. 
I reach my hand out...
And can't encapsulate the moon. 
And that manor....
The server was supposed to be a clean environment. 
That looks like an old manor of some romanian diplomat.
Masked Punk::
{additive: on}
"What the fuck?
Who the FUCK are you?"
{additive: off}
{fadeinsound: Szy Dark, 2}
{fadeoutsound: Star Piano, 2}
{fadeinsound: Flashstep, .3}
{moveChar: Masked Punk, .50}
"I come out to find some loser sneaking about?"
MC::
With inhuman speed, this..... demon, comes flying out of the treeline.
{additive:on}
Like a rocket, 
he comes flying, 
planting his feet, 
not two feet in front of me.
{additive:off}
The wind of his movement smacks me directly in the face. 
He is not human, he may be wearing normal clothes but...
The way he moves, is inhuman. 
He stands before me, his mask like an extension of his face. 
Like it IS his face. His mask even blinks.
An eerie green glow pulses from under his hood. 
No, this is NOT the server.
I am somewhere else, or this is a bad dream. 
My body still recuperating, I can only remain silent, and watch.
I can't move..... I am
SCARED. 
To much to process. 
WHO IS THIS????
Masked Punk::
"Hey......shithead, I asked you a question!"
MC:: 
I swallow.
"Name is MC, I just got here."
"Nice to meet you??"
NO way I can run. He is too fast. 
He looks...very capable of instant violence. 
There is nothing else I can do. 
{additive:on}
Either run, 
and get beat down.
{additive:off}
{additive:on}
Or stand, 
and get beat down.
{additive:off}
I need to show I am not a threat. 
<i>Not hard to do.</i>  
So, the only thing I can do....is offer my hand. 
"I was teleported here. I didn't mean to encroach on your property."
He looks at my hand, pausing, as if waiting for something.
Masked Punk::
"Encroach? What the fuck? What does that mean?!"
"Are you insulting me?!"
MC:: 
Oh shit...
"No No! It means trespass!"
I wave my hands in denial.
"Trust me, there is no reason to insult you."
Please don't smash me like a bug. 
Masked Punk::
"Huh? Well....."
He pauses. 
He looks down at my hand, and takes it. 
"In that case, name is Szycrotic."
Szycrotic:: 
{changeName: Masked Punk, Szycrotic}
MC::
As he grabs my hand, he pulls me close.
The mask is almost touching my nose. 
I swallow with careful deliberation.
This close up, the smell of sulfur fills my nostrils. 
Szycrotic::
"If you hurt this realm, or my Lord, I will cut you MANY times..."
He pauses and smiles with only his mask, green, glowing smoke, leaking out.
"Many times....."
MC::
When the hand shake starts to get unbearably uncomfortable, he suddenly pushes me back. 
He turns and starts walking to the manor, hand in pocket.
After a few steps, he stops, his head pivoting a little too far for a human.
His gaze pierces right through me. 
Szycrotic::
"It wasn't a request. You WILL come with me." 
"Lord Asterella will figure out what to do with you."
"You are <i>Encroaching</i> after all."
MC::
I only have a few seconds of reaction here. 
The dude is fast. 
If I go with him, this "Lord" may skewer me. 
Then again, I might be able to dodge him enough and get into the forest. 
{choice: What should I do? Don't get me killed player.}
 {
    Are you crazy? Run!
    [
       Ok, here goes nothing!
       {changeScript: Male/Prologue/Star I A}
    ]
    Caution. Death can happen here too. 
    [
       I don't think it's wise to anger a demon. I am alive, for now. 
    ]
 }
"Lead the way."
Nothing to do but hope I don't get killed. 
Or worse, tortured. This "guy" seems to be the type to enjoy pain.
For a brief second, disappointment flashes across his mask.
Szycrotic turns around and starts walking. 
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .2}
{fadeinsound: walkingongravel, 1}
{fadeoutsound: Szy Dark, 5}
{fadeinsound: Star Piano, 5}
Szycrotic looks over his shoulder to make sure I am still following. 
Szycrotic::
"You know, you are lucky Lord Star felt you before I did."
"I don't generally tolerate 'uninvited guests' as well as she does."
"Where did you come from?"
MC::
Play it safe, for now. 
"I just ended up here by accident. I can't really go into detail."
{additive:on}
Safe and true. 
I mean, who would believe me?
{additive: off}
I almost walk beside him. I mean there is only one path.
MC::
"Asterella Star? Is that this Lord's name?"
Szycrotic nods approvingly, glancing sideways at me, reassessing me.
Szycrotic::
"Yes. You seem to know her. Are you a Demon Lord? Or...."
MC::
I can't say I watched her streams. That skirts way too close to the actual truth. 
I have a feeling he might catch me in a lie as well. 
"I know OF her through friends. I hear she is very beautiful."
Szycrotic chuckles.
Szycrotic::
"Dude, you have no idea if you haven't met her yet. She is beyond just beautiful."
MC::
He pauses, kicking a rock off the path as he thinks.
Szycrotic::
{additive:on}
"She is like......the sexiest demon lord ever.
Only one other matches her, and she is fucking Satan, yo."
{additive:off}
MC::
He laughs openly.
Szycrotic::
{additive: on}
"They both disagree often. 
Ironmouse and Star are like sisters."
{additive: off}
MC::
Wait Ironmouse too?
Maybe they are just roleplaying?
"Are you saying IronMouse is in charge of all the Demon Lords in Hell?"
"And..........Asterella Star is one of them?"
Szycrotic::
"That's what I said, MC."
"But.....Ironmouse doesn't take her job that serious man." 
MC::
I can't help but just stare down the path at the outer wall.
The demon looks back at me with an amused glance.
Szycrotic::
{additive: on}
"And Star doesn't approve.
Star treats Mouse like she is the younger sister, 
running off and playing instead of being responsible."
{additive: off}
"The sparks that sometime's fly between those two.... you can't help but grab some popcorn and watch."
MC::
I mull over this.
"So where is this place? That I accidentally fell into?"
In front of us, an outer wall looms, hewn of ancient stone.
Vegetation grows in the cracks and crevices. 
Szycrotic waves a hand, and the main gates open.
Szycrotic::
"Welcome to the center of the 69th Circle of Hell, MC."
MC::
{additive:on}
We pass through the entrance in silence. 
I feel like he is giving me a chance to soak in the sights of the inner courtyard.
{additive:off}
And it is HUGE.
{additive:on}
Yard?
Hardly. 
It is a too big to be anything but a field.
{additive:off} 
Spread out across it are very carefully placed oaks, and ash, with small sitting spots and flowerbeds. 
Black, marble benches, are set in a mathmatically pleasing way, down the main walkthroughs. 
I still have to mainstain speed, so I try to soak in more. 
Like the HUGE waist deep fountain directly center of the main doors into the the Manor proper. 
{fadeoutsound: walkingongravel, 1}
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .50}
We stop in front of the 10 foot tall, ancient wooden doors. 
Szycrotic::
"I noticed you admiring the grounds. You think <i>that</i> is beautiful, wait until you go inside."
MC::
He pulls on the handle.
{fadeinsound: castle door, 1}
{fadeoutsound: Wind Heavy, 2}
Szycrotic::
"Better yet, wait until you meet Her."
MC::
We go into the largest mansion I have ever seen.......
{changeScene: Scenes/Star/Bedroom}
{fadeinsound: Star edm 1, 1}
{fadeinsound: fireplace, 1}
{spawnChar: malesilo, -1, Szycrotic}
{spawnChar: femalesilo, 2, Asterella}
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .25}
MC::
It took at least 5 mins of walking to get here. 
The mansion is almost a small village by itself, with many different rooms.
I lost count at 50 people in the short time I was counting. 
And.....
Szycrotic has been humming songs under his breath the entire way. 
{moveChar: Asterella, .75}
{additive: on}
As we come in, 
a stunning, young lady, 
reading a book on the couch,
looks up at us as we enter. 
{additive:off}
The floating crown made of diamonds, the long, slender horns. 
{additive: on}
Those black and lavendar eyes. 
This was surely Asterella Star. 
{additive: off}
{additive: on}
The transparent, orchid silk material, shifts suggestively, 
hugging her form in a very... sensual way.
{additive: off} 
Seeing her in person, with no screen. No barriers....
{fadeinsound: Heart Thump, .1}
My heart thumps in response. 
Szycrotic::
"My lady, Lord of the 69th Circle, Asterella. I bring forth the intruder, as requested...."
MC::
He bows deeply, in a very formal manner. 
{additive:on}
Huh. Honestly....it surprises me. 
I did not see that capability of polish to be in him.
{additive:off}
It brings it's own problems though. 
Asterella Star is a Demon Lord, in charge of a realm.
Whether or not I believe it to be genuine. THEY DO.
I remain silent.
Szycrotic::
"Was that good? I feel like that was good."
MC::
Still in mid bow, he looks back at me for support.....
I shrug... confused. 
Asterella::
"Szy...... that wasn't to bad, actually."
MC::
The welcome surprise in her voice reflects mine.
She closes the book with an air of finality, placing it on the table.
With one smooth motion, she is standing.
I stay in the half bow position with Szy.
The voice confirmed it. This is the Asterella Star from Twatch.
I know that voice all too well. Her streams are hilariously cursed at times. 
And her audience loves it. 
Szycrotic::
"Not bad huh? Do I get my reward then, woman?"
MC::
The blank look from Asterella was priceless.
Asterella::
"Ok stop bowing.... From you, that looks pretty silly."
MC::
A slight turn of her lips suggests a smile.
Asterella::
"And almost sarcastic."
MC::
She motions at me, looking at me for the first time.
Asterella::
"He is a pretty cute elven boy."
{additive:on}
"You can call me Star. 
There is no need for formality in here. 
Tell me, what is your name?"
MC:: 
"Name is MC, it is a pleasure to meet you."
Asterella::
"What a lovely name. MC."
MC::
She turns to Szycrotic.
Asterella::
"Yes, you may be rewarded."
"Go, see the Dungeon Master for your nightly punishment."
"I will attend to this...intruder."
MC::
Nightly....punishment???
Oh oh. 
What did I drag myself into?
Up close, the whole experience is surreal.
{additive: on} 
This is not some V-Tuber stream.
They seem to LIVE here. 
{additive: off}
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .1}
Szycrotic nudges me suggestively in the ribs as he heads out.
Szycrotic::
"I am weak compared to her..... Have fun."
{moveChar: Szycrotic, -1}
{moveChar: Asterella, .5}
MC::
{fadeinsound: Door, 1}
Star watches Szy close the door, with a look of satisfaction on her face. 
When the door closes, she sighs, closing her eyes for a brief moment.
