MC::
I feel no pain, no sensations at all.
I can't <i>feel</i> anything.
It's more like an awareness than a feeling.
My beating heart is the only sound reminding me I have a semblance of a body.
{additive: on}
Touch is irrelevant,
sound is irrelevant...
{additive: off}
I "hear", even though I don't have ears.
I'm sure of that.
The feeling of pressure around me changes slightly, like I am changing direction.
It's there, yet not, a shadow of pressure. The residue.
Inexorably, the "flow" guides me gently. I can only compare it to the flow of water rapids.
The sudden lurch and shift in direction wakes up my belly that no longer exists.
If I had a stomach right now, I would be violently puking up my last meal.
How much of our reactions are created by the brain?
How long?
{additive: on}
How long have I been gone?
Has it been a few seconds? 
Or longer?
{additive: off}
Another wrench of movement, causing my own reality to shift. I "separate" a bit.
{fadeinsound: Brain Sucking Chair Activate, 1}
"UGHHHHHH"
I become one again. 
Holy shit, this is scary! Did I just... come apart?
Did that even make noise?
I attempt to focus and can almost feel a direction.
"Yes, I feel 'forward.'"
I laugh, but I'm sure nothing came out.
{additive: on}
Forward, head first?
The lurches feel weird to me: as if there is no <i>true</i> resistance.
Except for the brick wall at the end of the cushion.
{additive: off}
Guiding me, instead of pulling or pushing. Like water down a pipe.
"I hope I'm not dead." 
"I don't think I'm dead."
It would really suck if I did die.
Angels, demons? Yeah, I am not exactly religious...
But, if this keeps up, I am about to be...
Why can't anime be real?
{fadeinsound: Brain Sucking Chair Activate, 1}
Holy! What the hell was that?!
Brain spasms, wrecking at my other thoughts.
Dying? Am I dying? Or is this normal?
Can't focus.....
ME! 
I am ME!
I tap on my soul...
Are you there?
Are <i>you</i> actually?
Or are you just a memory?
Am I dead? 
I am NOT DEAD!
