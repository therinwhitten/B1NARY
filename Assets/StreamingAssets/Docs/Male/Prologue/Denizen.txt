MC::
I feel no pain, no sensations at all.
I can't FEEL anything.
It is more like an awareness than a feeling.
My beating heart is the only sound reminding me I have a semblance of a body.
{additive: on}
Touch is irrelevant,
sound is irrelevant.
{additive: off}
I "hear", even though I do not have ears.
 I am sure of that.
The feeling of pressure around me changes slightly, like I am changing direction.
It is there, yet not, a shadow of pressure. The residue.
Inexorably, the "flow" guides me gently. I can only compare it to the flow of the rapids.
The sudden lurch and shift in the direction wakes up a belly that doesn't exist.
If I had a stomache right now, I would be violently puking up my last meal.
How long?
{additive: on}
How long have I been gone?
Has it been a few seconds? 
Or longer?
{additive: off}
Another wrench of movement, causing my own reality to shift. My whole body is not together.
"UGHHHHHH"
Did that even make noise?
I attempt to focus, and can almost feel a direction.
"Yes, I feel 'forward.'"
I laugh, but I am sure nothing came out.
{additive: on}
Forward, head first?
The lurches feel weird to me: as if there is no TRUE resistance.
Except for the brick wall at the end of the cushion.
{additive: off}
Guiding me, instead of pulling or pushing. Like water down a pipe.
"I hope I am not dead." 
"I do not think I am dead."
It would really suck if I did die.
Angels, demons? Yeah, I am not exactly religious.
{fadeinsound: Brain Sucking Chair Activate, 1}
Brain spasms, wrecking any other thoughts.
Dying?
Can't focus.....
ME! I am ME!
A tap on my soul.......
I am NOT DEAD!
