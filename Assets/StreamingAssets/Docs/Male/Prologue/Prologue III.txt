Narrator::
The window goes dark.
No one dares make a sound.
The quick chatter of the laptops betrays the sense of urgency and tension that permeates the room. 
{fadeinsound: Cliff Wood Tapping, .1}
Cliff::
Cliff leans on the back of Shirobi's chair, impatiently tapping on the wooden back.
Narrator::
On the screen, a diagnostic runs on the DIHI. 
Shirobi, pale as a ghost, just stares at the screen without really looking at it. 
{moveChar: Shirobi, .85}
{moveChar: Cliff, .15}
Shirobi::
"I promised him, Sir. That he would be ok.... I told him it would just be four days. And..."
Shirobi sighs in defeat.
{additive: on}
"I can't find him on any of the servers...
Is it possible just for the DIHI to just...
scramble him?"
{additive: off}
Cliff::
Cliff shakes his head. He refuses to accept that fate.
"We can't rule that out, but I am sure the DIHI is working as intended."
{additive: on}
"Many tests have already been done:
six months of preparation on that chair.
Six whole months..."
Cliff trails off, his body starting to shake. 
{additive: off}
"He's just a kid dammit!!"
{fadeinsound: Cliff Fist Wood, 1} 
{additive: off}
Narrator::
{additive: on}
The sound of a fist, 
loud in the otherwise quiet room, 
causes the team to jump. 
{additive: off}
Cliff::
"If the press had even suspected something was wrong..." 
Cliff looks down at his fist, forcibly relaxing it.
<i>Calm. I need calm.</i>
{additive: on}
"It's ok. 
We got four days to find him."
{additive: off}
The supervisor looks at Shirobi.
"Verify that test for me Shirobi, will you? I am tired.....
So tired."
{additive: off}
Cliff rubs the bridge of his nose in tired frustration.
Narrator::
{additive: on}
Shirobi, 
pale, and obviously worrying for his friend, 
shakes his head and gets back to work.
Silence reigns as the techs systematically check ports, settings on the DIHI, and the laptops.
{additive: off} 
Several minutes pass. Suddenly, someone pipes up.
{additive: on}
A young lab tech, fresh out of internship, 
looks up from the laptop from across the room, 
her auburn hair a mess, betraying the long hours of preparation for this experiment.
{additive: off}
{moveChar: Becks, .55}
Becks::
"Sir... I think I found the problem."
She leans back in her chair, and pivots, facing them.
"It's a big one."
Cliff::
Cliff can barely contain the impatience and exhaustion in his voice.
"Becks just say it. What did you find?"
Becks:: 
Becks opens her mouth, hesitates, then snaps it shut.
"Sir, you need to see this yourself."
Cliff::
{additive: on}
Cliff approaches,
unsure what he is supposed to see.
A normal diagnostic is running on the screen. His brow furrows, and he looks at Becks.
{additive: off}
"The scan isn't even finished yet. What am I looking for?" 
"Becks?"
Becks::
"Cliff, look at the lan status."
Becks moves the mouse over and clicks open the network settings.
"Here."
Narrator::
As Becks clicks on the network status, they both see the problem.
No local servers... none. One through ten should be there... 
One thing catches Cliff's attention, causing him to breath in sharply.
Cliff::
The Lab Supervisor suddenly looks at Becks questionably, and Becks nods.
Becks::
"It's been connected the entire experiment."
Cliff::
Cliff starts pacing, mumbling to himself, the words unrecognizable even to the lab crew. 
He pauses in his rambling and focuses his attention to Shirobi.
Panic, anger, and a light dose of despair paint his features clearly. 
"Good news, the DIHI is fine. MC was not scrambled at least."
Narrator::
{fadeoutsound: Fast Keyboard Typing, .5}
Shirobi stops typing, looking up. 
Shirobi::
"Wait... then what happened?"
Cliff::
"I can't believe I didn't... The DIHI is not connected to the servers, but the internet."
Shirobi::
Shirobi groans as he places his head between his hands.
"Ohhhhhh FUCK!"
The realization hits the room hard. 
Silence. Several seconds pass in dead silence.
Massaging his forehead, Shirobi's voice picks up.
"Sir, do we even have a chance to find him? I mean, he is the <i>only</i> human in the internet, but..."
Cliff::
The old man, looking at the laptop's screen, sighs and replies.
{additive: on}
"It's possible, 
but we would have to send AI into the code to search for his brain patterns and <i>hope</i> his patterns do not alter too much. 
If they do, we won't be able to find him."
{additive: off}
"I pray he lands somewhere semi-safe."
"Will ransomware or malware hurt him? There are so many unknown dangers that we have no clue on..."
Shirobi::
Shirobi, listening carefully, brightens up. 
"I've got it! We can trace through the browser history!" 
{additive: on}
"We can start there at least. 
How does that sound Chief? 
Focus our efforts. It narrows things down dramatically. But... Youbtube is so <i>huge</i> now...
We wouldn't know where an AI actually dwells without being a part the actual code."
{additive: off}
Cliff::
Cliff nods, never taking his eyes off the screen, grim determination replacing panic.
"MC needs us, team." 
{additive: on}
"He will be clueless. 
More alone than any man has ever been. 
The only human in the digital world. 
I <i>hope</i> that is enough to find him."
{additive: off} 
His eyes focus on Shirobi. The command in his voice strong.
"Get MC's thought-pattern impressions inputted into the mainframe and start training the AI."
"I want a full-spread sweep started in the next 12 hours."
Becks::
"What about the press Sir?"
Cliff::
Cliff glances over at Becks.
"We have four days to find an answer."
"For now, we will play it off as typical secretive corporate lab techs." 
He ends the sentence with a bit of irony.
"We can use that stereotype to buy us some time."
"In the meantime, you try to figure out a good way to explain to the world what is happening." 
"If we can't find him by then, there will be some serious backlash on this."
With Cliff's path clear, his confidence comes back.
"And get someone to do a complete scan of the DIHI. Ensure the report is..."
As Cliff continues to push out instructions to his team, he can't help but feel a pang of incredible sadness. 
The kid is fresh out of college.
Cliff knows about the kid's parents, and they really wouldn't care if he vanishes.
From his meeting with them, they seemed annoyed he was involved in the project.
{additive: on}
The MC is socially inept, and normally withdrawn.
A bright young man to be sure,
but inclusive to the ones around him.
{additive: off}
From his profile, he is a resourceful lad.
He hopes that wherever he is, he will be smart enough to pace himself and make careful considerations...
"Don't be stupid, MC. You have to be very careful. There is no telling what is in there."
"There are things in the internet that we still can't comprehend..."
