Narrator::
The window goes dark.
No one dares make a sound.
The quick chatter of the laptops betray the sense of urgency and tension that permeates the room. 
{fadeinsound: Cliff Wood Tapping, .1}
Cliff::
Cliff leans on the back of Shirobi's chair, impatiently tapping on the wooden back.
Narrator::
On the screen, a diagnostic runs on the DIHI. 
Shirobi, pale as a ghost, just stares at the screen without looking at it. 
{moveChar: Shirobi, .85}
{moveChar: Cliff, .15}
Shirobi::
"I promised him, Sir. That he would be ok.... I told him it would just be four days. And..."
Shirobi sighs in defeat.
{additive: on}
"I can't find him on any of the servers...
Is it possible just for the DIHI to just...
scramble him?"
{additive: off}
Cliff::
Cliff shakes his head. He refuses to accept that fate.
"We can't rule that out, but I am sure the DIHI is working as intended."
{additive: on}
"Many tests have already been done:
six months of preparation on that chair.
Six whole months........."
Cliff trails off, his body starting to shake. 
{additive: off}
"He is just a kid dammit!!"
{fadeinsound: Cliff Fist Wood, 1} 
{additive: off}
Narrator::
{additive: on}
The sound of a fist, 
loud in the otherwise quiet room, 
causes the team to jump. 
{additive: off}
Cliff::
"If the press had even suspected something was wrong..." 
Cliff looks down at his fist, forcibly relaxing it.
<i>Calm. I need calm.</i>
{additive: on}
"Its ok. 
We got four days to find him."
{additive: off}
The supervisor looks at Shirobi.
"Verify that test for me Shirobi, will you? I am tired.....
So very tired."
{additive: off}
Cliff rubs the bridge of his nose in tired frustration.
Narrator::
{additive: on}
Shirobi, 
pale, and obviously worrying for his friend, 
visibly shakes his head and gets back to work.
Silence reigns as the techs systematically check ports, settings on the DIHI, and the laptops.
{additive: off} 
Several minutes pass. Suddenly, someone pipes up.
{additive: on}
A young lab tech, fresh out of internship, 
looks up from the laptop from across the room, 
her auburn hair a mess, betraying the long hours of preparation for this experiment.
{additive: off}
{moveChar: Becks, .55}
Becks::
"Sir, I think I found the problem."
She leans back in her chair, and pivots, facing them.
"Sir, it's a big one."
Cliff::
Cliff, impatient, the sound of exhaustion in his voice,
"Becks just say it. What did you find?"
Becks:: 
Becks opens her mouth, hesitates,  then snaps it shut.
"Sir, you need to see this yourself."
Cliff::
{additive: on}
Cliff approaches,
unsure what he is supposed to see.
A normal diagnostic is running on the screen. His brow furrows, and he looks at Becks.
{additive: off}
"The scan isn't even finished yet. What am I looking for?" 
"Becks?"
Becks::
"Sir, look at the lan status."
Becks moves the mouse over and clicks open the network settings.
"Here."
Narrator::
As Becks clicks on the network status, they both see the problem.
No local servers...none. One through ten should be there... 
One thing catches Cliff's attention, the intake of breath sharp. 
Cliff::
The Lab Supervisor suddenly looks at Becks questionably, and Becks nods.
Becks::
"It has been connected the entire experiment."
Cliff::
Cliff starts pacing, mumbling to himself, the words unrecognizable, even to the lab crew. 
He pauses in his rambling, and looks up at Shirobi.
Panic, anger, and a light dose of despair paints his features clearly. 
"Good news, the DIHI is fine. MC was not scrambled, at least."
Narrator::
{fadeoutsound: Fast Keyboard Typing, .5}
Shirobi stops typing, looking up. 
Shirobi::
"Wait...then what happened?"
Cliff::
"That isn't the problem. The DIHI is not connected to the servers, but the internet."
Shirobi::
Shirobi groans as he places his head between his hands.
"Ohhhhhh FUCK!"
The realization hits the room like hard.
Silence. Several seconds pass in dead silence.
Massaging his forehead, Shirobi's voice picks up.
"Sir, do we even have a chance to find him? I mean he is the ONLY human in the internet but...."
Cliff::
The old man, looking at the laptop's screen, sighs and replies.
{additive: on}
"It's possible, 
but we would have to send AI into the code to search for his brain patterns, and HOPE his patterns do not alter too much. 
If they do, we won't be able to find him."
{additive: off}
"I pray he lands somewhere semi-safe."
"Will ransomware or malware hurt him? There are so many unknown dangers that we have no clue on...."
Shirobi::
Shirobi, listening carefully, brightens up. 
"I got it! We check the browser history of the laptop and check all the websites it was connected to!" 
{additive: on}
"We can start there at least. 
How does that sound Chief? 
It can at least focus our efforts. Youbtube is so HUGE now...
And we wouldn't know where an AI actually dwells without being a part of a structure."
{additive: off}
Cliff::
Cliff nods, never taking his eyes off the screen, grim determination replacing panic.
"MC needs us, team." 
{additive: on}
"He will be clueless. 
More alone than any man has ever been. 
The only human in the digital world. 
I <i>hope</i> that is enough to find him."
{additive: off} 
His eyes focus on Shirobi. The command in his voice strong.
"Get MC's thought pattern impressions inputted into the mainframe and start training the AI."
"I want a full-spread sweep started in the next 12 hours."
Becks::
"What about the press Sir?"
Cliff::
Cliff glances over at Becks.
"We have four days to have an answer."
"For now, we will play it off as typical secretive corporate lab techs." 
He ends the sentence with a bit of sarcastic contempt.
"We, at least,  can use that stereotype to buy us some time."
"In the meantime, you try to figure out a good way to explain to the world what is happening." 
"If we can't find him by then, there will be some serious backlash on this."
Cliff's path clear, his confidence comes back.
"And get someone to do a full scan of the DIHI and ensure the report is...."
As Cliff continues to push out instructions to his team, he couldn't help but feel a pang of incredible sadness. 
The kid was fresh out of college.
Cliff actually knows about the kid's parents, and they really wouldn't care if he vanishes.
{additive: on}
The MC is socially inept, and normally withdrawn.
A bright young man to be sure,
but very inclusive to the ones around him.
{additive: off}
From his profile, he is a pretty resourceful lad.
He hopes that where-ever he is, he will be smart enough to pace himself and make careful considerations...
"Don't be stupid, MC. Be as careful as a bull in a china shop."
"There are things in the internet that we still do not comprehend..."
