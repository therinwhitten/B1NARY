MC::
{fadeinsound: footsteps run forest, .5}
Off through the trees I run, not caring for the brush I ram through.
{additive:on}
Once I hit full speed, 
I realize, a little too late, 
that this probably was not a good idea.
{additive:off} 
{additive:on}
My body, 
not exactly prime fitness material to begin with, 
is still reeling from the teleportation.

{fadeinsound: body punch hard, 1}
OUCH!
My leg hits a branch, and I almost trip. 
I feel a hand, solid as iron grasp my shoulder. 
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .5}
Szycrotic::
"You want to do this the hard way eh?"
"Haha very well."
MC::
"I panicked! Don't cut me!"
Szycrotic::
"What are you stupid? I won't cut you. Not yet."
"No seriously, you haven't hurt this realm bro. Just yourself."
"It's bleeding man."
MC::
I look down, and see a small bit of blood oozing through my pants. 
By the time I notice the blood, the throbbing pain catches up to my brain. 
I groan a bit, a sharp intake of breath coming after. 
Szycrotic laughs behind me.
Szycrotic::

{"I haven't stuck anything in you yet, Daddy."}
{"Calm down bro."}
