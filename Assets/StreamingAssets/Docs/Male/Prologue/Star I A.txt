MC::
{fadeinsound: footsteps run forest, .5}
Off through the trees I run, not caring for the brush I ram through.
{additive:on}
Once I hit full speed, 
I realize, a little too late, 
that this probably was not a good idea.
{additive:off} 
{additive:on}
My body, 
not exactly prime fitness material to begin with, 
is still reeling from the teleportation.
{additive:off}
{fadeinsound: body punch hard, 1}
OUCH!
My leg hits a branch, and I almost trip. 
I feel a hand, solid as iron grasp my shoulder. 
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .5}
Szycrotic::
"You want to do this the hard way eh?"
"Haha very well."
MC::
"I panicked! Don't cut me!"
Szycrotic::
"What are you stupid? I won't cut you. Not yet."
"No seriously, you haven't hurt this realm bro. Just yourself."
"It's bleeding man. Look."
MC::
I look down, and see a small bit of blood oozing through my pants. 
By the time I notice the blood, the throbbing pain catches up to my brain. 
I groan a bit, a sharp intake of breath coming after. 
Szycrotic laughs behind me.
Szycrotic::
**TODO: Make henable**
if: henabled, true
"I haven't stuck anything in you yet, Daddy."
if: henable, false
"Calm down bro. Just gonna tie you up."
MC::
Suddenly, I feel iron grips grabbing my wrists. 
For a second, I try to fight, but there is no stopping him. 
His strength far exceeds mine. 
I give up, and soon enough, ropes are around my wrists behind my back. 
{additive: on}
Szycrotic moves around to face me, 
studying me. 
Although, with his mask, it is kind of hard to read his expressions.
{additive: off}
His mask cracks in a smile. 
Szycrotic::
"One more rope should suffice."
MC::
He places a rope around my neck, securing it with just enough room to breath.
Szycrotic::
"Oh this is fun. I am GLAD you ran."
MC::
{additive: on}
I say nothing. 
There is nothing to say. 
Inside of five minutes in the digital realm, I am already a prisoner.
{additive:off}
Szycrotic turns around, satisfied with his handiwork.
Szycrotic::
"Ok BOY. Les goooo!"
MC::
"It's not 'boy.' It's MC."
He tugs on the rope, and I follow grudingly.
Szycrotic::
"You got some balls man. Ok MC."
"We will see if those balls don't shrink meeting Lord Asterella."
MC::
That name tickles my memory.
Asterella....Star?
"Asterella Star?"
As we walk, he grunts appreciatively.
Szycrotic::
"Pretty Calm for being tied up. Yes, LORD Asterella Star."
"You seem to know her at least. Be sure to show her proper respect. She is a busy woman."
MC::
Asterella Star: A V-Tuber know as the Demon Lord of the 69th Circle of Hell. 
She is just a streamer though.....
And Szycrotic, that name might actually be a streamer's as well. 
Yet, a streamer doesn't move like a damn demon either. 
Am I on Twatch??
"Hey Szycrotic."
Szycrotic::
"Yeah?"
MC::
"Are we actually in the 69th Circle of Hell?"
Szyroctic::
He laughs. 
"Where else would we be? Of coarse we are!"
"You did this to yourself. No one comes here without Her express permission."
"And somehow, some weak ass punk, was able to just waltz in here."
