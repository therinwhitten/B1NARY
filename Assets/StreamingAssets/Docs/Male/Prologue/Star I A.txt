MC::
{fadeinsound: footsteps run forest, .5}
Off through the trees I run, not caring for the brush I ram through.
{additive:on}
Once I hit full speed, 
I realize, a little too late, 
that this probably was not a good idea.
{additive:off} 
{additive:on}
My body, 
not exactly prime fitness material to begin with, 
is still reeling from the teleportation.
Running almost fast enough to fall forward, I lose balance momentarily.....
{additive:off}
{fadeinsound: body punch hard, 1}
OUCH!
My leg hits a branch, and I almost trip. 
I feel a hand, solid as iron, grasp my shoulder. 
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .5}
Szycrotic::
"You want to do this the hard way eh?"
"Haha very well."
MC::
"I panicked! Don't cut me!"
Szycrotic::
"What are you stupid? I won't cut you. Not yet."
"No seriously, you haven't hurt this realm bro. Just yourself."
"It's bleeding man. Look."
MC::
I look down, and see a small bit of blood oozing through my pants. 
By the time I notice the blood, the throbbing pain catches up to my brain. 
I groan a bit, a sharp intake of breath coming after. 
Szycrotic laughs behind me.
Szycrotic::
**TODO: Make henable**
if: henabled, true
"I haven't stuck anything in you yet, Daddy."
if: henable, false
"Calm down bro. Just gonna tie you up."
MC::
Suddenly, I feel iron grips grabbing my wrists. 
For a second, I try to fight, but there is no stopping him. 
His strength far exceeds mine. 
I give up, and soon enough, ropes are around my wrists behind my back. 
{additive: on}
Szycrotic moves around to face me, 
studying me. 
{additive: off}
Although, with his mask, it is kind of hard to read his expressions.
His mask cracks in a smile. 
Szycrotic::
"One more rope should suffice."
MC::
He places a rope around my neck, securing it with just enough room to breath.
Szycrotic::
"Oh, this is fun! I am GLAD you ran."
MC::
{additive: on}
I say nothing. 
There is nothing to say. 
Inside of five minutes in the digital realm, I am already a prisoner.
{additive:off}
Szycrotic turns around, satisfied with his handiwork.
Szycrotic::
"Ok BOY. Les goooo!"
MC::
"It's not 'boy.' It's MC."
He tugs on the rope, and I follow grudingly.
Szycrotic::
"You got some balls man. Ok MC."
"We will see if those balls don't shrink meeting Lord Asterella."
{moveChar: Szycrotic, -2}
{fadeinsound: walkingongravel, 1}
{fadeinsound: Star Piano, 4}
{fadeoutsound: Szy Dark, 3}
MC::
That name tickles my memory.
Asterella....Star?
It hits me like a truck. 
"Asterella Star? I <i>do</i> know that name."
As we walk, he grunts appreciatively.
Szycrotic::
"Pretty Calm for being tied up. Yes, LORD Asterella Star."
"You seem to know her at least. Be sure to show her proper respect. She is a busy woman."
MC::
Asterella Star: A V-Tuber know as the Demon Lord of the 69th Circle of Hell. 
She is just a streamer though.....
And Szycrotic, that name might actually be a streamer's as well. 
The name is very familiar.
Yet, a streamer doesn't move like a damn demon either. 
Am I on Twatch??
No fucking way.
No way.
"Hey Szycrotic."
Szycrotic::
"Yeah?"
MC::
"Are we actually in the 69th Circle of Hell?"
He laughs. 
The shadows concealed how very well built the path we were on is. 
Old stone, hewn by hand, and worn over a very long time. It is almost like pavement.
Szycrotic:: 
"Where else would we be? Of coarse we are!"
"You did this to yourself, man. No one comes here without Her express permission."
"And yet, somehow, some weak ass punk, was able to just waltz in here."
Szycrotic shakes his head in disbelief.
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .50}
{fadeoutsound: walkingongravel, 1}
MC::
He stops for a second, and studies me for a moment. 
Szycrotic::
"You know, it's possible you are <i>pretending</i> to be weak and just into this shit."
MC::
The smile is bigger, like he WANTS that to be the truth. 
"Seriously, who likes to be tied up and manhandled like a sack of potatoes?"
I mumble this in defiance a bit. 
Szycrotic::
"Hurt Me Daddy......OH!"
He laughs as he jerks the rope and starts moving again.
{fadeinsound: walkingongravel, 1}
{moveChar: Szycrotic, -2}
MC::
I have no control over my situation. 
And I know of Asterella Star. In fact, I have watched many of her streams in the past. 
If she is really here, then maybe I can get some help.
I feel myself frown a bit. 
Yet......Szycrotic doesn't seem like he is roleplaying at all.
He thinks he <i>is</i> a demon. 
Will Star be the same way?
I feel a jerk on my ropes, the knot digging into my wrists a bit. 
It almost pulls me off balance, and I instinctively adjust against it. 
Szycrotic::
"We are wasting time. Speed up! No dragging your heels...."
{fadeoutsound: Szy Dark, 5}
{fadeinsound: walkingongravel, 1}
MC::
We trudge closer to the manor, step by step.
I have never been tied like this before. 
I almost....ALMOST chuckle at my situation.
As we near the huge mansion, I realize that this isn't just a manor in the woods. 
There is a whole complex, with multiple buildings surrounding it.
We pass the threshold of the outer wall, and my eyes take in the elegant beauty. 
The lawn is too large to be called a lawn. 
Spread out across it are very carefully placed oaks, and ash, with small sitting spots and flowerbeds. 
{fadeinsound: waterfountain, 2}
Black, marble benches, are set in a mathmatically pleasing way, down the main walkthroughs. 
I still have to mainstain speed, so I try to soak in more. 
Like the HUGE waist deep fountain directly center of the main doors into the the Manor proper.
{fadeoutsound: waterfountain, 4} 
{fadeoutsound: walkingongravel, 1}
{fadeoutsound: Star Piano, 3}
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .50}
We stop in front of the 10 foot tall, ancient wooden doors. 
Szycrotic::
"I noticed you admiring the grounds. You think <i>that</i> is beautiful, wait until you go inside."
MC::
He pulls on the handle.
{fadeinsound: castle door, 1}
Szycrotic::
"Better yet, wait until you meet Her."
MC::
We go into the largest mansion I have ever seen.......
