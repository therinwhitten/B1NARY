<i>I can't stop myself from sweating;</i>

     Don't turn around.....

         <i>I feel the hand grip me tight. And twirl me around.</i>

<i>And my eyes get a full blast of white light from those high tech digital cameras.</i>

{spawnChar: malesilo, 2, John}
{moveChar: John, .85}
John::
"MC! 
Are you ok? You look very....unsteady."
<i>John laughs to allievate the obvious tension in the room.</i>  
"Must be nerve wracking for billions of people to watch you make history, am I right?"
MC::
<i>Damn lights!</i>
<i> So bright I can't see who made that comment!</i>
<i> I squint.</i>
{additive: on}
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>DUDE,</i>
<i>it's fucking stagefright.....</i>
<i>Totally.</i>
{additive: off}
<i>So naturally, I dryly, and very sarcastically, quip back.</i>
"Yeeah. Nervewracking." 
<i>I swallow some acid down. I lick my chapping lips a bit.</i>
<i>I gesture at the behemoth sitting in the center of the room.</i> 
"I would be lying if I didn't say the DIHI doesn't make me nervous."
{spawnChar: malesilo, -1, Cliff}
{moveChar: Cliff, .20}
<i>Eyes start to adjust, and I notice Cliff, the lead project manager, behind the press; arms crossing in combination to a stern face.</i> 
<i>His posture is clearly saying, 'If you mess this up, there goes your pay for a year.'</i>
<i>No one is saying anything! Oh..... Right...</i> 
<i>Panicking, I open my mouth.</i>
"Don't worry, though.  Digital Horizons is the ONE company I would trust with the task of sending me to a server." 
"I know they will bring me back in one peice. Of that, you can be assured."
<i>Hopefully I come back with all of my memories.</i>
<i>So many things to forget: my internship, my parents, my hentai collection.....</i>
<i>Would I even be the same person if I lost my memories?</i>
<i>My mom and dad never really care about how I am doing.</i> 
<i>I spend most of my time just watching streams, anime, some hentai on the side.</i>
{additive: on}
<i>So,</i>
<i>the notion of going into the digital world has always caught my curiosity. </i>
{additive: off}
<i>How cool would it be to live in the Internet? Would I be able to just sit in a streaming site, or watch a Youbtube video?</i>
{additive: on}
<i>Would I need to eat,</i>
<i>sleep?</i>
{additive: off}
<i>Or perhaps, more questionable things? Would it even feel the same in the digital world?</i>
<i>I mentally shove my thoughts aside. They can tell I am spacing out now. </i>
<i>I am feeling a bit awkward here. So, I try to smile and put a thumb up.</i>
<i>I hear a chuckle somewhere! The voice sounds familiar.</i> 
<i>Damn lights!</i>

{moveChar: Shirobi, .75}
Shirobi::
"Well, at least he seems to have calmed his nerves a bit." 
MC::
<i>My eyes shoot daggers at him.</i>
<i>That nasal little otaku ass!</i>
<i>That is Shirobi, my roommate, the lead tech intern.</i>
<i>So annoying when he thinks he is right, or looking cool, he always pushes up his glasses like he is some protagonist in an anime.</i>
{additive: on}
<i>He is a cool friend sometimes though. He is always willing to help a buddy out:</i>
<i>either with some advice, or some light novels. </i>
{additive: off}
<i>I intake a breath.</i>
 "I am ready."
Shirobi::
<i>Shirobi walks up and puts a hand on my shoulder.</i>
"I will be watching your vitals, to ensure nothing happens, Bud."
"You know.....I wouldn't let you get near this chair unless it was safe." 
"Only four days, and out. Ok?"
MC::
<i>I nod, taking in the room.</i>
<i>The press are being guided outside of the room. The only people inside were me, the lab techs and Cliff. </i>

<i>The sound of the DIHI suddenly changes, and the feel of ionizing in the air increases.</i>
{fadeinsound: DIHI Up Close, 1}
<i>I look into the observation lounge window, where reporters, and lab technicians are chatting.</i>
<i>It looks like they are grabbing coffee and seating themselves. </i>
{additive: on}
<i>My body won't do anything weird</i>
<i>like have a perpetual stiffy like a corpse....right?,</i>
{additive: off}
<i>I will look like I am peacefully sleeping......right?</i>
Shirobi::
<i>Shirobi snorts, obviously stifling laughter.</i>
{additive: on}
"Really?
Going to be sitting a multi billion dollar chair, and that is what you think about?" 
{additive: off} 
MC::
<i> Wait.....Did I just say that out loud?</i>
Shirobi::
"You will be fine. You will bascially be a vegetable, ableit, a very boring, and very unhorny one."
<i> He empasizes the horny part.</i>
"The stasis is top tech, man. Remember the briefings...." 
"So no worries. I will make sure we have a team watching you 24/7."
MC::
<i>I laugh, it bursting out a little louder than I intend.</i> 
"Ok then, I guess no time like the present."
<i> I look grimly at Shirobi, my eyes imploring him to take this seriously.</i>
"Shirobi, I am putting my complete and utter faith in you."
{additive: on}
"No one,
and I mean
NO ONE,
touches my 'collection'
ok?"
{additive: off}
Shirobi::
<i>Shirobi smiles.</i> 
"I got you man. Just focus on making history ok?"
MC::
<i>I walk to the center of the room, looking straight at the chair.</i>

<i>It vibrates my bones as I get closer.</i>
<i>The DIHI fills my whole vision.</i>
{additive: on}
<i>It really feels like a portal to another world,</i>
<i>like I really am getting isekaied. </i>
{additive: off}
<i>And just that fast, the reality of my situation hit's home. And I take the last few steps, staring down at the DIHI. </i>
<i>It's just four days...... Four days of being in a server.</i>
<i>Right now, I am looking at the culmination of a decade of research in front of me.</i>
<i>Hundreds of Ph.D-level scientists have been working in R and D for at least 4 years on this chair.</i>
<i>Tendrils of coolant mists kept emanating from the contraption.</i>
<i>Shirobi moves to the console that attaches to the chair. He hits a few buttons and the scanners shut down, opening the path to the chair. The hum lowers in volume a bit. </i>
Shirobi::
"It's ready MC. Just sit down, and relax." 
<i>Shirobi motions with a curt nod towards the solid, metallic chair.</i> 
MC:: 
<i>The last step.</i>
<i>I can't hear anything but my heart, and the background hum of the brainsucking chair, resonating with my bones.</i> 
<i>All the pulsing light eats at the darkness surrounding it, enveloping me as well.</i>
<i>The hum vibrates the metal paneling under my feet as I stare at the digitation throne of horrifyng implications.</i>
<i>With a sudden burst of courage, I pivot and sit down, with the humming droning in my skull.</i>
<i>I can barely hear anything.</i>
<i>With my breath quick in my ears, I exhale, forcing it to slow.</i>
 "Light me up Shirobi."
Shirobi::
"Jeez dude! Poor choice of words." 
<i>He sighs, looking at the expectant press in the observation room.</i>
"It will be ok man. Just lean your head back, relax, and close your eyes."
MC::
{additive: on}
<i>Ok.</i>
<i>Ok.</i>
<i>You can do this!</i>
{additive: off}
<i>I close my eyes, losing myself in the vibration of the chair. </i>
"See you in a couple of hours!"
<i>I open my eyes and send a sidelong glance at my roomate.</i>
"Wait will I know how to breathe and all that?" 
Shirobi::
"MC, just close your eyes man." 
MC::
{fadeinsound: DIHI Power Up, 1}
<i>I close my eyes, suddenly feeling like I have alot more to lose than I previously expected.</i>
<i>They have never succeeded. My heart skips a beat, loud in my ears.</i>
<i>A wave of panic grips me as I start to tear up. </i>
<i>Is this my last moment of being aware of myself?</i>
<i>I feel my head start to tingle.</i>
<i>The sounds of the chair is all I hear other than my own heartbeat.</i>
<i>No press, no coworkers; just my heartbeat, the thrum of the chair, and my sudden fear of being alone. </i>
