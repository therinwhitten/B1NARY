Shirobi:: 
"Why the Brave MC! He has been an intern with the company for over a year now....."
MC::
<i>The noise registers as words for a split second as I am being escorted into the Brain Sucking Room. The lab techs hate when I call it that, but to look at that....THING as anything else, would be an excerise of brainwashing. </i>
<i>I can't stop myself from sweating; I hear my heartbeat thumping rhythmically in my ears. Mechanical whirring of laptops, server fans, and the hum of the EM fields surrounding the chair, resonate inside my skull.</i>

<i>I focus on my feet. That seems to work ok. Distractions are a boon right now. I try to block out all the mumbling of the reporters.</i>
<i>Suddenly, someone grabs my shoulder, instantly causing me to jump. I whirl, and my eyes get a full blast of white light from those high tech digital cameras. The light erases my distractions, and I attempt to blink away the brightness.</i>

Reporter::
"MC! Are you ok? You look very....unsteady."
The reporter laughs to allievate the obvious tension in the room.  
"Must be nerve wracking for billions of people to watch you make history, am I right?"
MC::
<i>Damn lights! So bright I can't see who made that comment!</i>
<i> I squint.</i>
<i>Yeah, DUDE, it's fucking stagefright.....Totally.</i>
"Yeeah." I dryly, and very sarcastically quip back.
<i>I swallow some acid down.</i>
"I would be lying if I didn't say the DIHI doesn't make me nervous." I gesture at the behemoth sitting in the center of the room. 
{spawnChar: malesilo, -1, Cliff}
{moveChar: Cliff, 0}
<i>Eyes start to adjust, and I notice Cliff, the lead project manager, behind the press; arms crossing in combination to a stern face. His posture is clearly saying, 'If you mess this up, there goes your pay for a year.'</i>
<i>No one is saying anything! Oh..... Panicking, I open my mouth.</i>
"Don't worry, though.  Digital Horizons is the ONE company I would trust with the task of sending me to a server. I know they will bring me back in one peice. Of that, you can be assured."
<i>Hopefully I come back with all of my memories.</i>
<i>So many things to forget, my internship, my parents, my hentai collection. Would I even be the same person if I lost my memories?</i>
<i>My mom and dad never really care about how I am doing. I spend most of my time just watching streams, anime, some hentai on the side. The notion of going into the digital world has always caught my curiosity. </i>
<i>How cool would it be to live in the Internet? Would I be able to just sit in streaming site, or watch a Youbtube video? Would I need to eat, sleep? Maybe do other things?</i>
<i>I mentally shove my thoughts aside. They can tell I am spacing out now. </i>
<i>I am feeling a bit awkward here. I smile and put a thumb up.</i>
<i>I hear a chuckle somewhere! The voice sounds familiar. Damn lights!</i>

{moveChar: Shirobi, .75}
Shirobi::
"Well, at least he seems to have calmed his nerves a bit." 
MC::
<i>I shoot daggers at him.</i>
<i> That nasal little otaku ass!</i>
<i>That is Shirobi, my roommate, the lead tech intern. So annoying when he thinks he is right, or looking cool, he always pushes up his glasses like he is some protagonist in an anime. He is a cool friend sometimes though. He is always willing to help a buddy out: either with some advice, or some light novels. </i>
I intake a breath. "I am ready."
Shirobi walks up and puts a hand on my shoulder.
Shirobi::
"I will be watching your vitals, to ensure nothing happens. I wouldn't let you get near this chair unless it was safe. It's only four days, and out. Ok?"
MC::
<i>I nod. Taking another look around the room. The press are being guided outside of the room. The only people inside were me, the lab techs and Cliff. </i>

{fadeoutsound: LabAmbience, 1}
<i>The sound of the DIHI suddenly changes, and the feel of ionizing in the air increases. I look into the observation lounge window, where reporters, and lab technicians are chatting. It looks like they are grabbing coffee and seating themselves. </i>
<i>My body won't do anything weird like have a perpetual stiffy like a dead dude....right? I will just look like I am peacefully sleeping......right?</i>
Shirobi::
"Really MC?" Shirobi snorts, obviously stifling laughter. 
MC::
<i> Wait.....Did I just say that out loud?</i>
Shirobi::
"It will be fine. You will bascially be a vegetable, ableit, a very unhorny one. We will store you immediately in a form of room-temperature stasis." 
"No worries. I will make sure we have a team watching you 24/7."
MC::
I laugh, it bursting out a little louder than I intend. 
"Ok then, I guess no time like the present."
"Shirobi, I am putting my complete and utter faith in you. No one, and I mean NO ONE touches my 'collection' ok?"
Shirobi::
Shirobi smiles. 
"I got you man. Just focus on making history ok?"
MC::

{fadeinsound: Heartbeat, 1}
<i>I walk to the center of the room, looking straight at the chair. It vibrates my bones as I get closer. The DIHI fills my whole vision. It really feels like a portal to another world, like I really am getting isekaied. </i>
<i>The reality of my situation hits home. And I take a step. </i>
<i>It's just four days. Four days of being in a server. I am looking at the culmination of a decade of research in front of me. Hundreds of Ph.D-level scientists have been working in R and D for at least 4 years on this chair.</i>
<i>Tendrils of coolant mists kept emanating from the contraption. Shirobi moves to the console that attaches to the chair. He hits a few buttons and the scanners shut down, opening the path to the chair. The hum lowers in volume a bit. </i>
Shirobi::
"It's ready MC. Just sit down, and relax." Shirobi motions with a curt nod towards the solid, metallic chair. 
MC:: 
<i>Another step. The heartbeat in my ears starts increasing. I can't hear anything but my heart, and the background hum of the brainsucking chair, resonating with my bones.</i> 
<i> All the pulsing light eats at the darkness surrounding it, enveloping me as well. The hum vibrates the metal paneling under my feet as I take yet another step and stare at the digitation throne of horrifyng implications.</i>
<i>With a sudden burst of courage, I pivot and sit down, with the humming droning in my skull. I can barely hear anything.</i>
With my breath quick in my ears, I exhale, forcing it to slow. "Light me up Shirobi."
Shirobi::
"Jeez dude! Poor choice of words." The tech admonishes. He sighs, looking at the expectant press in the observation room.  "It will be ok man. Just lean your head back, relax, and close your eyes."
MC::
<i>Ok. Ok. You can do this!</i>
<i>I close my eyes, losing myself in the vibration of the chair. </i>
"See you in a couple of hours. Wait will I know how to breathe and all that?" I open my eyes and send a sidelong glance at my roomate.
Shirobi::
"MC, just close your eyes man." 
MC::
<i>I close my eyes, suddenly feeling like I have alot more to lose than I previously expected. They have never succeeded. My heart skips a beat, loud in my ears. A wave of panic grips me as I start to tear up. </i>
<i>Is this my last moment of being aware of myself? I feel my head start to tingle. The sounds of the chair are all I hear other than my own heartbeat. No press, no coworkers; just my heartbeat, the thrum of the chair, and my sudden fear of being alone. </i>
<i>Then, with an almost gut wrenching lurch, everything suddenly feels like it is being pulled to the top of my head.......</i>
