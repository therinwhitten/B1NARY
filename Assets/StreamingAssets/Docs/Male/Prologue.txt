Shirobi:: 
"MC! He has been an intern with the company for over a year now....."
MC::
<i>The noise registers as words for a split second as I am being escorted into the Brain Sucking Room.</i>
<i>The lab techs hate when I call it that, but to look at that....THING as anything else, would be an excerise of brainwashing.</i>
<i>I can't stop myself from sweating; I hear my heartbeat thumping rhythmically in my ears.</i> 
<i>Mechanical whirring of laptops, server fans, and the hum of the EM fields surrounding the chair, resonate inside my skull.</i>

{additive:off}
<i>I focus on my feet. That seems to work ok.</i>
<i>Distractions are a boon right now. I try to block out all the mumbling of the reporters.</i>
<i>Suddenly, someone grabs my shoulder, instantly causing me to jump.</i>
{fadeoutsound: Heartbeat, 1}
{changeBG: DIHI Room Animated}
<i>I whirl, and my eyes get a full blast of white light from those high tech digital cameras.</i>
<i>The light erases my distractions, and I attempt to blink away the brightness.</i>
{spawnChar: malesilo, 2, John}
{moveChar: John, .85}
John::
"MC! Are you ok? You look very....unsteady."
<i>John laughs to allievate the obvious tension in the room.</i>  
"Must be nerve wracking for billions of people to watch you make history, am I right?"
MC::
<i>Damn lights! So bright I can't see who made that comment!</i>
<i> I squint.</i>
<i>Yeah, DUDE, it's fucking stagefright.....Totally.</i>
<i>So naturally, I dryly, and very sarcastically, quip back.</i>
"Yeeah. Nervewracking." 
<i>I swallow some acid down. I lick my chapping lips a bit.</i>
<i>I gesture at the behemoth sitting in the center of the room.</i> 
"I would be lying if I didn't say the DIHI doesn't make me nervous."
{spawnChar: malesilo, -1, Cliff}
{moveChar: Cliff, 0}
<i>Eyes start to adjust, and I notice Cliff, the lead project manager, behind the press; arms crossing in combination to a stern face.</i> 
<i>His posture is clearly saying, 'If you mess this up, there goes your pay for a year.'</i>
<i>No one is saying anything! Oh..... Right...</i> 
<i>Panicking, I open my mouth.</i>
"Don't worry, though.  Digital Horizons is the ONE company I would trust with the task of sending me to a server." 
"I know they will bring me back in one peice. Of that, you can be assured."
<i>Hopefully I come back with all of my memories.</i>
<i>So many things to forget, my internship, my parents, my hentai collection. Would I even be the same person if I lost my memories?</i>
<i>My mom and dad never really care about how I am doing.</i> 
<i>I spend most of my time just watching streams, anime, some hentai on the side. So, the notion of going into the digital world has always caught my curiosity. </i>
<i>How cool would it be to live in the Internet? Would I be able to just sit in a streaming site, or watch a Youbtube video? Would I need to eat, sleep?</i>
<i>Or perhaps, more questionable things? Would it even feel the same in the digital world?</i>
<i>I mentally shove my thoughts aside. They can tell I am spacing out now. </i>
<i>I am feeling a bit awkward here. I smile and put a thumb up.</i>
<i>I hear a chuckle somewhere! The voice sounds familiar.</i> 
<i>Damn lights!</i>

{moveChar: Shirobi, .75}
Shirobi::
"Well, at least he seems to have calmed his nerves a bit." 
MC::
<i>My eyes shoot daggers at him.</i>
<i>That nasal little otaku ass!</i>
<i>That is Shirobi, my roommate, the lead tech intern.</i>
<i>So annoying when he thinks he is right, or looking cool, he always pushes up his glasses like he is some protagonist in an anime.</i>
<i>He is a cool friend sometimes though. He is always willing to help a buddy out: either with some advice, or some light novels. </i>
<i>I intake a breath.</i>
 "I am ready."
<i>Shirobi walks up and puts a hand on my shoulder.</i>
Shirobi::
"I will be watching your vitals, to ensure nothing happens, Bud."
"I wouldn't let you get near this chair unless it was safe." 
"It's only four days, and out. Ok?"
MC::
<i>I nod, taking in the room.</i>
<i>The press are being guided outside of the room. The only people inside were me, the lab techs and Cliff. </i>

{fadeoutsound: Small-Group-Whisper, .5}
<i>The sound of the DIHI suddenly changes, and the feel of ionizing in the air increases.</i>
<i>I look into the observation lounge window, where reporters, and lab technicians are chatting. It looks like they are grabbing coffee and seating themselves. </i>
<i>My body won't do anything weird like have a perpetual stiffy like a dead dude....right?,</i>
<i>I will just look like I am peacefully sleeping......right?</i>
Shirobi::
<i>Shirobi snorts, obviously stifling laughter.</i>
"Really MC?"  
MC::
<i> Wait.....Did I just say that out loud?</i>
Shirobi::
"It will be fine. You will bascially be a vegetable, ableit, a very unhorny one."
<i> He empasizes the horny part.</i>
"We will store you immediately in a form of room-temperature stasis." 
"So no worries. I will make sure we have a team watching you 24/7."
MC::
<i>I laugh, it bursting out a little louder than I intend.</i> 
"Ok then, I guess no time like the present."
<i> I look grimly at Shirobi, my eyes imploring him to take this seriously.</i>
"Shirobi, I am putting my complete and utter faith in you."
"No one, and I mean NO ONE, touches my 'collection' ok?"
Shirobi::
<i>Shirobi smiles.</i> 
"I got you man. Just focus on making history ok?"

{fadeinsound: DIHI High Power, .1}
MC::
<i>I walk to the center of the room, looking straight at the chair.</i>
{fadeinsound: slowfootsteps, 1}
<i>It vibrates my bones as I get closer. The DIHI fills my whole vision. It really feels like a portal to another world, like I really am getting isekaied. </i>
<i>And just that fast, the reality of my situation hit's home. And I take the last few steps, staring down at the DIHI. </i>
<i>It's just four days. Four days of being in a server.</i>
<i>Right now, I am looking at the culmination of a decade of research in front of me.</i>
<i>Hundreds of Ph.D-level scientists have been working in R and D for at least 4 years on this chair.</i>
<i>Tendrils of coolant mists kept emanating from the contraption.</i>
<i>Shirobi moves to the console that attaches to the chair. He hits a few buttons and the scanners shut down, opening the path to the chair. The hum lowers in volume a bit. </i>
Shirobi::
"It's ready MC. Just sit down, and relax." 
<i>Shirobi motions with a curt nod towards the solid, metallic chair.</i> 
MC:: 
<i>The last step.</i>
<i>I can't hear anything but my heart, and the background hum of the brainsucking chair, resonating with my bones.</i> 
<i>All the pulsing light eats at the darkness surrounding it, enveloping me as well.</i>
<i>The hum vibrates the metal paneling under my feet as I stare at the digitation throne of horrifyng implications.</i>
<i>With a sudden burst of courage, I pivot and sit down, with the humming droning in my skull. I can barely hear anything.</i>
<i>With my breath quick in my ears, I exhale, forcing it to slow.</i>
 "Light me up Shirobi."
Shirobi::
"Jeez dude! Poor choice of words." 
<i>The tech admonishes.</i>
<i>He sighs, looking at the expectant press in the observation room.<i>
"It will be ok man. Just lean your head back, relax, and close your eyes."
MC::
<i>Ok. Ok. You can do this!</i>
<i>I close my eyes, losing myself in the vibration of the chair. </i>
"See you in a couple of hours!"
"Wait will I know how to breathe and all that?" 
<i>I open my eyes and send a sidelong glance at my roomate.</i>
Shirobi::
"MC, just close your eyes man." 
MC::
<i>I close my eyes, suddenly feeling like I have alot more to lose than I previously expected.</i>
<i>They have never succeeded. My heart skips a beat, loud in my ears. A wave of panic grips me as I start to tear up. </i>
<i>Is this my last moment of being aware of myself?</i>
<i>I feel my head start to tingle. The sounds of the chair is all I hear other than my own heartbeat.</i>
<i>No press, no coworkers; just my heartbeat, the thrum of the chair, and my sudden fear of being alone. </i>
<i>Then, with an almost gut wrenching lurch, everything suddenly feels like it is being pulled to the top of my head.......</i>
