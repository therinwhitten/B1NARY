MC::
<i>I feel no pain, no sensations at all.</i>
<i>I can't FEEL anything.</i>
<i>It is more like an awareness than a feeling.</i>
<i>My beating heart is the only sound reminding me I have a semblance of a body.</i>
{additive: on}
<i>Touch is irrelevant,</i>
<i>sound is irrelevant.</i>
{additive: off}
<i>I "hear", even though I do not have ears.</i>
<i> I am sure of that.</i>
<i>The feeling of pressure around me changes slightly, like I am changing direction.</i>
<i>It is there, yet not, a shadow of pressure. The residue.</i>
<i>Inexorably, the "flow" guides me gently. I can only compare it to the flow of the rapids.</i>
<i>The sudden lurch and shift in the direction wakes up a belly that doesn't exist.</i>
<i>If I had a stomache right now, I would be violently puking up my last meal.</i>
<i>How long?<i>
{additive: on}
<i>How long have I been gone?</i>
<i>Has it been a few seconds? </i>
<i>Or longer?</i>
{additive: off}
<i>Another wrench of movement, causing my own reality to shift. My whole body is not together.</i>
"UGHHHHHH"
<i>Did that even make noise?</i>
<i>I attempt to focus, and can almost feel a direction.</i>
"Yes, I feel 'forward.'"
<i>I laugh, but I am sure nothing came out.</i>
{additive: on}
<i>Forward, head first?</i>
<i>The lurches feel weird to me: as if there is no TRUE resistance.</i>
<i>Except for the brick wall at the end of the cushion.</i>
{additive: off}
<i>Guiding me, instead of pulling or pushing. Like water down a pipe.</i>
"I hope I am not dead." 
"I do not think I am dead."
<i>It would really suck if I did die.</i>
<i>Angels, demons? Yeah, I am not exactly religious.</i>
{fadeinsound: Brain Sucking Chair Activate, 1}
<i>Brain spasms, wrecking any other thoughts.</i>
<i>Dying?</i>
<i>Can't focus.....</i>
<i>ME! I am ME!</i>
<i>A tap on my soul.......</i>
<i>I am NOT DEAD!</i>
