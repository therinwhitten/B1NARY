MC::
"Ahhh."
Beams of light assault my closed eyes. 
NOOOOO! That was an awesome dream. I don't want to wake up yet!
I've got time. The alarm hasn't...
//Audio: Alarm Clock going off.
...
"Great."
Where is that damn thing?
Protecting my eyes against the evil sunlight, I search with my hand for the clock. Where is it?
I feel plastic button. I press.
// Audio: Click Alarm turns off.
Laying in bed, with my hand over my eyes, I slowly boot up my brain. Shit, I already forgot the dream. 
Figures. 
Did I have my alarm turned on for a reason? 
"Hmmm"
"Isn't it Saturday? I shouldn't have any classes today..."
No study sessions either. No tests. 
...
...
...
What was it? Maybe I had some chores to do online? An essay?
A date?
// Audio: Sarcastic Laugh
Yeah I <i>would</i> remember that. 
I'm not ugly at all. Just really, really shy. I mess up my words all the time. And usually it's at the worst possible time. 
Then... What? 
No studying plan because there are no tests for me. Of coarse not, I won't be available for a while. 
Oh...
// Eyeblink
<i>Oh...</i>
"Whelp, I remember now!", I declare to the ceiling. 
My mind starts slamming all the information from yesterday into my forethoughts. 
Boot up complete. 
I'm not in the real world anymore. I look at the ceiling that is not my own: the one I'm starting to grow fond of. This is my personal house here. Mine. 
Even though it's digital, I've never lived alone before. Yet, I'm here by myself, with no contact plan with Shirobi, and no leads. I have one option I wanted to try. 
There is one. The train station I noticed. I mean, a train station has trains that go places right? It wouldn't just <i>be</i> here. 
Where would I go? How would it solve my issue with communication?
I glance at the alarm clock. 
6:05am. I need to at least get to this station today. <i>That</i> is why I decided to toture myself. Trains normally start moving early morning. And I'm racing against the clock right now. 
Those eyes, that tore through me.
Remembering the intention, I shiver a bit. That eye contact was creepy, and very invasive. I felt like someone was stripping my clothes off and looking for scars. 
// Audio: Squeaking
"Whelp, here I go!"
Raising out from under the covers, I grunt a bit, sitting on the side of the bed, rubbing the final vestiges of sleep out of my eyes. Coffee, the liquid blessed by the Gods, is calling to me. 
{if: henable, true}
{
    Good thing I'm in my own house and alone. Currently I'm making a pup tent with my boxers. 
    I chuckle.
    "Must have been a good dream!"
    I stand up a bit awkwardly, 'adjusting' myself a bit.
}
The cold air feels nice on my bare feet. Leaving the bed unmade, I head to the closet to grab some fresh clothes.  I would use yesterdays, but that's a bad habit to get into. I can wash my clothes here, after all. 
// Audio: Clothes Rustling
A nice black shirt with an anime joke on it is a perfect choice to match my current mood. Some sloppy blue jeans. Perfect. 
It's facinating how everything in this closet is something I would wear. 
// Audio: closing door , grabbing wallet and keys. 
Pocketing my wallet and keys, I walk downstairs to brush my teeth. 
The bathroom? It's huge for such a small home. I really like the dual setup. 
Laundry is where you brush your teeth at the sink. Another door opens to reveal a quick shower spot, with a full size bath.
Somehow, it all feels so familiar to me, and I can't exactly place <i>why</i>. I know this home. Maybe it will come to me?
// Audio: Brushing teeth and spitting into the sink.
I spit into the sink, admiring the long, pointed ears. 
"My hair's a fucking mess.", I lament. 
Easy. I cup some water into my palms and run my hands through my hair, combing out the snags. There we go! All cleaned up.
In minutes, after cleaning the living room, and snatching the coffee from the fridge, I'm locking the front gate, scanning the map.  Water puddles, and the smell of ozone is still prominent. It was quite a storm, but the pc was able to drown out most of the noise. 
I haven't seen any serious flooding yet. Frankly, I hope to avoid it. 
Pocketing my keys, I start my journey.
// Audio: Walking
It's very quiet, but in a calming way. If nature could sigh, this is what it would feel like. I glance down the map. Ah, so a right at the train tracks. I don't see anyone walking about this early. It's around 6:40am. 
I keep looking up just in case. 
The sun must have risen only a hour ago. The chill immediately makes me regret not looking for a jacket. I shiver despite myself. At the walk is warming me up!
// Audio: Splashing footsteps.
The AI here: do they actually get up and live normal lives? And if they do, who do they do this for? There's no one here to simulate the real world. Yet, the NPC's seem to be doing <i>just</i> that. 
About two blocks down, I spy and older lady going to her mailbox in sleep clothes and some slippers.  Why would <i>that</i> be in her programming, unless it's to show to someone? 
Dodging an exceptionally large puddle, I watch her head back into her home. Other than the old lady, the world feels like it's still asleep. 
MC::
"I should be too.", I mutter, sipping on the coffee. 
The tracks come up fairly quickly, and I turn right at the intersection to get to the station. It looks like the Station is just outside of town. As I'm trotting along faithfully, I come to realize that I probably should have eaten before I left. 
It's a train station! It should have some vending machines. I hope so. Even the glorified pit stops with covered benches at least had a vending machine or two. 
I chuckle. The real question in my mind right now is <i>where</i> would a train in the internet travel to?
I'm not stupid, but I lack alot of common sense. I'm aware of that. I'm flying in the dark here. I need to understand what's going on. 
A small part of me is very excited, and wants to know <i>more</i>.
// Audio: Footsteps stops
Impossible. What year is this? 
The houses fell back about 1/4 of a mile behind me, with fields of rice replacing urban streets. Just outside of town, I see a single platform "Train Station" with a few vending machines. One... two ways in via locked gates to bar the way. 
I can jump over those easy, but it's not what has me gaping. 
The bullet train is next gen. I can't describe it. It's silver with blue and yellow highlights. I can see 5 cars and an "engine." The material doesn't look like a metal I have seen yet. 
As if on cue, the horn goes off. Someone is <i>there</i>!
I hesistate. 
Fuck it. 
// Audio: slow trot. 
I start walking, then jogging, instantly leaping over the gates that bar my way. I will NOT miss this train. 
//Audio: Gravel on feet
As soon as my feet hit the gravel and pavement, I resume a run, the crunch loud in the silence. 
NO NO NO!
Almost there!
The fifth car, the one closest to the engine, opens. 
"There!", I yell. 
I make a beeline to that door. 
<i>If the door is opening, then you don't have to run. It's not leaving.</i> 
The little voice in my head is too late. 
// Audio: feet scraping. Trying to stop.
I try to slow down, raising my free hand to try and brace against the train. 
Two feet from the door, as if in slow motion, a sapphire-eyed beauty steps out, humming to herself. 
"Shit! Look out!"
At the sound of my voice, she looks up, eyes widening in alarm. Her mouth opens.
I stop, two feet from her, her head titling to look up at me. 
She screams in full panic mode. 
// Audio: Aoi full scream
I open my mouth to apologize, but it's too late. 
Her lithe body bunches up, her foot comes at my neither region.
{choice: Dodge or attempt a block!}
{
    Dodge!
    [
        // Audio: Crunch Sound
        I attempt to dodge, but it's too late. 
        The small foot, seeming so lithe, lands with perfect precision right into my nutsack. 
        The pain erupts like a wave, crippling my voice in a split second. 
        //Audio: Can dropping
        My sight blurs. I can't <i>breathe</i>!
        I lose all control of my limbs, as my body collapses to the ground, ears ringing. The world is pain. <i>I am pain. </i>
        My stomach is a core of agony. I want to vomit. 
        God! Why?!
        I regain some control and cuddle myself into a fetal position to lessen the pain, to withdraw. Clenching my eyes shut tight against the pain, I fight the urge to pass out. 
        Train Lady::
        "Oops! Sorry! Your nuts were at the end of my foot there. You kind of startled me."
        MC::
        Nonchalant is the best word to describe her tone. 
        Train Lady::
        "Charging at a lady like that! What do you expect?! Jeez."
        MC::
        I would respond. If I said anything though, I'm not sure what would even come out. I try to slow my breathing, willing the throbbing pain to ease.
        // Audio: Coughing Male MC
        "Sorry." It comes out hoarse and sqeaky. 
        I swallow audibly. 
        "I just...want...a...ride?"
        Fighting through tears, I look up. She is looking down at me, concern painted on her face a bit now. <i>Just a touch of concern</i>. 
        Train Lady::
        "Oh."
        Silky and long silver hair with tinges of blue frames a delicate face. There is a hint of pleasure she is trying to hide in her eyes. 
        <i>She enjoyed it!</i>
        Well, in the current circumstances, a woman alone... I can try here. 
        <i>She is your ride too, MC.</i>
        Yes, I know. 
        I let the pain ease up enough to stand up. I won't have her thinking it is <i>that</i> bad. 
    ]
    Block! 
    [
        // Audio: Suspenseful music.
        It's coming!
        Time gels. My precious little troopers are in danger!
        Fuck! Can't dodge!
        // Audio: can dropping
        I blindly trust my instincts to protect my family jewels from their imminent demise.
        Both hands go down, crossing to create a solid barrier. Her shin strikes my forearms, the jolt pushing me back a half step to gain my balance. 
        //Audio: block sound
        Precise, and packing <i>much</i>more power than I would expect from someone with such a tiny frame.
        Holy shit! Was she trying to geld me?!
        The foot comes down and I look up at her face. 
        She is about my age at first glance. Maybe older? Her silver hair frames a delicate face. The blue eyes are tearing up a bit. 
        Wait, is that... <i>disappointment?</i>
        I open my mouth.
        MC::
        "I'm terribly sorry! Trust me, you have <i>every</i> right  to defend yourself. I mean no harm. I just... want a ride."
        I trail off...
        She looks disappointed. That's disappointment...
    ]
}
MC::
Still though...
I can't help it.
"I know I scared you, and I'm sorry for that! But still. That kick begs me to ask the question:"
I cough a bit.
"Were you trying to remove any chance I have of reproducing with that kick?"
The young lady harrumphs, with a pout forming on her lips.
Train Lady::
"Not on purpose....eh.. what's your name?"
MC::
"MC. Pleased to meet you." I say dryly.
She recovers quickly, making a light curtsey.
Train Lady::
"Hello, MC. My name is Aoi Miyuki."
{changeName: Train Lady, Aoi}
MC::
Her face resets, all past emotions gone in an instant: a clear sky.
"Aoi Miyuki? The streamer?", I query. 
Did I hear her right? 
Aoi::
"Oh do you know about me? I stream almost daily on Twatch."
