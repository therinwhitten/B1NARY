//(Background: MC Front Yard and Street)
MC::
//(open and close door sounds : Metal Gate)
//(footsteps, birds chirping)
As I open the outergate, I peer north and south along the road. 
North: seems like it meanders away from the center of the small city. 
If I want to book it, that would probably be the best route.

    MC::
    Good thing there was <i>some</i> food in the fridge. 
    I'm still hungry but the edge is gone, thankfully.
    "I will cherish that pickle. Oh Sweet Pickle God."
}
{if: !maleatepickle}
{
    //(Stomach Growling Sounds)
    I blanch a bit. Yeah. No time to explore at the moment. 
    There is a hole in my stomache now and I really need to get some food in me. 
    So north is out of the question, for now.
}
//(laugh out loud Vince!)
I really didn't expect my first couple of hours in the digital world would be spent hunting for food like some kind of surivalist...
An intrusive thought pops in to my head of me in loincloth, cooking grass over a fire in the middle of the street...
I stomp it out and head south.

Not complaining!

It's making me wonder how clueless we are in general. The techs at Digital Horizons have Ph.D's in all kinds of fields. All the tests, verifications...
I'm really forging a path here.  Tech that is shrouded with many unknowns.
Truly, I am on my own in here.

//(Thunder sounds)
The storm is creeping closer. 
I really don't want to be caught out in the rain. Can I catch a cold here?
Wait... what?
The first time since coming here, I see people. A pair of school girls, walking right past me.
Both were clearly Japanese. They glance at me for just a second, and continue their conversation. 
School Girl 1::
"This is our last week! Why would Mr. Sunsui drop an assigment on us?! Finals are over."
School Girl 2::
"I have cram school in a month! Did it look hard at least?"
School Girl 1::
"Screw him, finals are done, and so am I."
MC::
Then, they pass me. 
I can understand them perfectly. 
I don't know Japanese. Well um, a bit? Enough to call someone a baka. That's it though.
So how?
I abruptly turn, my mouth opening before I realize. 
"Excuse me?"
The sound that comes out is raspy. A sudden burst of introverted anxiety creeps up. They may be getting ready for college, but that still makes them teenagers!
Teenagers are dangerous.
I clear my throat.
They watch me, standing about 5 feet away. The taller girl is facing me, her piercing blue eyes cautiously assessing me. 
SCARY!
School Girl 2::
"Yes sir?"
MC::
The reply has a melodic, almost scripted response?
The 'sir' hurts me more than expected. I got maybe, <i>maybe</i> 4 years on both of them. They are both about to enter college, after all. 
Yet, that gap feels like a huge chasm right now. 
Scratching the back of my head, I put an apologetic smile on my face. 
"Hi, I was wondering if you could point me to the nearest store? It would help me a ton."
<i>YOU</i> are speaking Japanese too!
They're not real MC. They're NPCs. Programs. 
The tall girl's face brightens up. She points down the path I am heading. 
School Girl 2::
"I can help you! There is a Lawsons down the road, if that is what you mean? It's right past the train tracks."
MC::
The girl's friend frowns.
School Girl 1::
"Are you new in town?
MC::
How much do I say?
I hesitate.
"Yeah I just moved in today. Just trying to snatch some grub so I can unpack actually."
They <i>sound</i> normal to me. Yet, I can't shake the feeling I am talking to two programs here.  Their emotions feel surface level deep only. 
No time to consider this MC. They are watching you lost in thought.
She turns to her friend and whispers something. 
Schoolgirl 2::
"Yeah they have maps at Lawsons too, so you can get to know the area. You are lucky! This part of town has almost everything within walking distance."
"I'm sure the clerk there will give you a map for free if you ask nicely. And welcome to _____."
MC::
What? She clearly said something, but I didn't hear the name of the city.  Keeping my smile on I nod.
Schoolgirl 1::
"You speak amazing Japanese for a foreigner by the way! The store is about 1 km. You can't miss it."
MC::
"I appreciate it. Thank you very much!"
I bow slightly. 
The tall girl smiles, no expression reaching her eyes. 
School Girl 2::
"Welcome! Laters!"
MC::
With a casual wave, they start walking again, back to their prior conversation.
Sighing, I turn and continue walking.
I speak fluent Japanese... How?
And Lawsons? Isn't that a Japanese store chain? It's not possible I'm in Japan, but I can't decide exactly how to digest this information.
Is this residue from my own perspective? Can the mind really change my surroundings this much?
Even the way those two girls look in their uniforms. How much of my subconcious mind is involved here? 
I'm not that dense. 
Everything I have seen so far is pointing at me. I am the architect of this place. In a way it makes some sense. 
It almost feels like a comfort mechanism that the brain employs to protect itself. 
Those two came from <i>my</i> mind? That's alarming. The features of each of their faces were so unique to each other. 
Does that mean I can control people??
"Shirobi would be estatic." I proclaim aloud. 
The first report is going to take a <i>long</i> time. Shirobi is basically a closet Otaku. We already know this. 
Yeah yeah. He is a serious scientist. His skill and knowledge in the field are a shining star in the community. 
However, his soul? It belongs to cat girls and maid cafes. 
//(Audio: Sounds of people tlaking. Mopeds, Train Bells going off.) 
I look up from the ground. I almost walk over the tracks, as the wooden bar plops down in front of me, lights flashing. I look around and realize I am not the only person waiting. 
There are about 10 people milling about, of all walks of life and age. 
The air is cooler, denser. You can feel the storm moving in. Daylight is starting to wane. 
Late Afternoon. 
// (Background Change:  Cloudy Afternoon intersection: Train Sounds in the backgorund with people talking. Train Bells)
I look past the bar as the train becomes a blur, filling my vision, not 1 meter from me. 
I can see people standing up holding onto bars, looking at phones, sitting down and chatting as it whizzes by...
Blue hair...
In the light, the reflections are shooting my face back at me through the windows.
I squint. That is not me. Or rather, not the <i>real</i> me.
I'm my online avatar.
Dark blue eyes, light blue hair draping over long and slender elf ears. I touch the tips. They look and feel real! Lost in thought, I just study my self reflection, unsure exactly how to feel. 
I blink, and the image blinks with me. It's ME.
And then, the train is gone, and I am staring at a very uncomfortable pedestrian across the tracks. 
Heat rises in my cheeks as I nod a silent apology. 
// (Sounds: Train fades, bells stop)
I don't move. I can't. I allow the realization to sink in. I'm an elf. I'm my avatar on Twatch. Only difference is my clothes, which is what I would wear if I could after work. 
And no one, absolutely no one, cares whether or not I have long pointy ears. Not even the side long, confused looks you would get from cosplaying. Nothing.
I watch the people, no NPCs, walk around their preprogrammed lives. For a brief moment, I feel a sudden rise of panic and isolation. 
<i>Ignore it.</i> Food; then we can have an existential crisis. 
//(Audio: pedestrian footsteps. A few cars going by)
I resume walking, looking more closely at the denizens of this world, searching for clues, anything that I might be able to use to tell them apart from real people. The amount of traffic eerily picks up, or am I just now noticing it?
Yes there is a difference. Their movements and actions are just a touch to timed, organized, or mechanical to be organic. 
These are all independent programs. I don't <i>think</i> I'm controlling them with my brain, and alot of the faces don't even look familiar to me. 
// (Audio: Footsteps stop)
Waiting for the pedestrian lights to go green, I observe a group of NPCs in front of Lawsons chatting it up in Japanese and laughing. 
The smells of food waft across the street. 
My stomache agrees it's a pleasant smell with a nice grumble. A handful of NPCs waiting with me glance at me curiously.
I chuckle. "Oh boy! I guess I shouldn't have skipped lunch huh?" It came about a bit forced. 
A man in his middle age starts to laugh, then trails off. He looks tired and overworked...
The light goes green, and we all together start crossing the street. 
It's surreal: it feels like a real place! The smells of freshly prepared ramen, chicken, pork, and hot dogs seep into my nose. 
Making a beeline directly for the convenient store, my pace picks up. 
I no longer care what kind of scene I'm making. I hunger. 
//(Background Change Inside Lawsons, Sound of People checking out at the register, and walking. Some lame ass generic music on the radio)
I pick a promising isle full of chips, squeezing past some pedestrians. 
"Excuse me."
There's my goal! 
The <i>entire</i> back wall has hot food, microwaves, and fountain drinks. Premade and delectable to a starving man. 
Like a laser finder, I make my way. SCORE. 
Bento boxes, premade sandwiches, and even some good looking sushi.
//(audio: Grabbing basket)
I'm snatching Bento boxes and sandwiches before I even have a basket. Ah there they are!
Wow! What is that? I snatch an unknown sandwich packet.  Grab some drinks and head to the counter.
//(Background Change: Cash Register. Silo of Cashier, Sounds of rustling stuff and scanning. )
{spawnChar: malesilo3, -1, Lawsons Clerk}
{moveChar: Lawson Clerk, .25}
I'm suddenly in front of a middle aged gentleman, his stubble and tired eyes reflecting the line growing behind me. 
I know that pain...
I quickly place all my items on the counter, organizing them to make them easier to scan. He looks up at me with a light smile of appreciation.
"Excuse me sir." I meet his eyes.
Ok this feels like an anime. He just looks defeated. He's trying his best though. His scanning is tried and true. 
Lawsons Clerk::
"Yes? What can I help you with sir?"
MC:: 
There is a touch of impatient urgency to his tone. I peek behind me to notice the line forming again. 
Shit. There was only a handful of people in here when I made it inside. 
Polite smile.
"Yes, sorry to bother you. Do you have a map of the town I can buy?" I try to look a bit hopeful.
He sighs while ringing up the last few drinks, placing them expertly into another bag. Without even looking, he reaches behind the counter, procuring a folded map and tossing it on top of one of the bentos.
Lawsons Clerk::
"It's free man. You a tourist?"
MC::
Judging from his expression, he already knew the answer. Just being nice. <i>Does he think I am cosplaying?</i>
"From America, sorry." I admit. 
I wonder how they view tourists? I have seen some pretty cringe worthy posts online...
A genuine laugh erupts from him suddenly, erasing the tension from his face. 
Lawsons Clerk::
"It's not a crime man. Enjoy the city!"
"That will be 9000 yen please."
MC::
I hand him the money and collect my bags, heavy with food. Walking for the door...
Lawsons Clerk::
"Hey!"
MC::
I turn to his voice, and catch an umbrella just-in-time from kissing my face. 
Confusion.
Lawsons Clerk::
"It's about to rain. You don't want a cold. Oh and free of charge."
MC:: 
He smiles brightly, the exhaustion briefly vanishing for a split second. And with that, he focuses on the next order. 
I smile back in thanks and head outside.
That dude is going to be mah friend!
//(Background Change: Door opening, and the door chime.  Rain and the sound of the umbrella opening.)
Huge water droplets smack the pavement, and some of the moisture splatters onto my clothes and face as I adjust the umbrella. 
It's a cold rain. 
I <i>must</i> protect the treasure that is my food!
Stepping aside from the main entrance so as not to be a bother to customers, I go fishing for the hot chicken fries I specifically bought for the walk home.
Inhaling them is no problem. I barely taste them. The hunger cares not. 
I need to head home, and gather my bearings. I have a map, and a purpose. 
HOT HOT! Piping hot chicken juice squirts onto one of my fingers and I lick them without shame.
//(increasing rain sounds)
The sky is darkening more than it should. I need to head back now. 
//(Audio: Intake of breath, heartbeat)
Eyes target me, and I focus across the street. There, in a group of people, <i>someone</i> is studying me. I try to make out who it is, but the rain's not letting up. The small group is a blur to me. 
Eyes piercing, weighing me. Judging my worth. I feel a chill that has nothing to do with the rain. It's more than a program. There is sentient intentions behind this glare. 
Emotionless... Like a machine.
//(Coughing)
Oh, I <i>did</i> inhale my chicken fry. I beat on my chest to no avail, coughing sporadically. 
Tears in my eyes, I look back across the street. The feeling was just... Gone. I scan both directions along the road. 
Up until this moment, it has almost felt like a fever dream. Like a vacation to Japan. I'm a fan, for sure. At least, for this afternoon, I forgot where I was. 
I am in a simulation right now. And, I can't really tell whether or not this is all in my head, or this whole area is an add on the techs installed. 
//(Audio, footsteps and the green light sound)
I make my way across the street, still chewing absently on my chicken fries. They're probably really good,  but right now? 
They taste like cardboard. That was not an NPC.
When I get to the road to my house, I look again for the mysterious eyes. 
I mentally tic off what looks like a train station off to the west. The lines and iconography looks a bit familiar too. I may need to explore that place tommorow. 
Good thing the route home is an easy one. I might get lost with the dark and rain pummeling my umbrella. 
//(background change:)
<i>Lost in thought.</i>
This server feels so <i>real</i>! I can't my head beyond this main point. The details are so minute and thorough. I don't think my mind is capable of this level of detail, at least conciously. 
Prebuilt?
There are several things that stick out to me:
{additive: on}
1.  
This is a closed server, which the lab techs have again and again informed me it would be empty.
Well, except for me.
Devoid of extra programming.
{additive: off}
{additive: on}
2. 
I feel everything as it's real life. Can I get a cold? <i>Can</i> I actually get sick?
Temperature, touch, hearing, sight, and even taste! It all feels real!
My brain cannot tell the difference at all. 
{additive: off}
{additive: on}
3. 
The NPCs. 
Those eyes! That was intent being projected at me. NPC's here have different levels of polish. 
Where the girls felt like they had pre-defined scripts, the Cashier was more fleshed out with AI? 
That distinction might save my skin later. 
{additive: off}
//(Background Change: )
Ah the railroad tracks! Almost "home."
{additive: on}
4. 
Food: I have to eat and drink? 
Is the mind expecting substance?  What does this need even mean for me?
Is my brain feeding on energy to stay alive? 
{additive: off}
{additive: on}
5. 
My house...
It seems very familiar. Everytime I lay my eyes on the phone, or the Kitchen, something tickles my memory. 
I don't think I have seen it in real life though. 
The house, at least, I think my mind fabricated. 
{additive: off}
{additive: on}
6. 
What can't I contact the team? 
What haven't <i>they</i> attempted to contact me?
Is there some form of time dialation? Is a whole day just a few minutes in the real world? 
That could make sense. 
{additive: off}
The priority is eating and establishing contact. 
//(Footsteps stop)
//(Background Change)
I gaze at the angry, dark sky, rain pelting my umbrella. My house looks dark and ominous in the storm. 
It's getting pretty late, and I feel exhaustion throbbing through my body. 
I need sleep. Kind of a buzzkill. The mind still needs sleep, even here...
