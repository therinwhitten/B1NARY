MC::
As I get close to the door, I start fumbling for the keys while juggling all my loot.
Even with the streetlamps, light sources don't help much. 
//(Audio: Door Opening and closing. Light switch)
Finally home!
"Whew."
I fumble for the light switch at the front of the genkan. I shield my eyes as the light momentarily blinds me. 
//(Audio: Foot Fumbling. Taking shoes off. Closing umbrella.)
It's time to eat!
Making a beeline to the kitchen, my stomach rumbles again. Even inside, the rain pelting on the roof is loud.
"Man! It's really coming down!"
The realism in this world keeps fooling me. Even the behavior of rain, the air pressure, everything, down to the smallest detail, is accurate.
Is all of this preprogrammed and controlled by AI? 
If this is a server Shirobi programmed, I want to see if he would make me something a little more UwU, if you catch my drift. 
I marvel at how comfy I feel in this kitchen, instantly finding the trash can as I remove lids and store the food and drink in the fridge and cupboards.
It's almost as if I made this house myself.
Sushi and green tea is what I'm already preparing. 
//(Audio: Twist cap and drink)
The tea is cool and crisp with just the right amount of sweetness. I study the living room for the first time. 
A nice leather couch in front of a large oak table, and an older flatscreen tv. 
Time to see if at least the TV works. Got to watch something while I eat after all. 
//(Audio: Remote Click and TV coming on)
It works!
News Broadcaster::
"The 14th Cyclone has made it to landfall this evening, hammering central Japan. Minor flooding is being reported in some of the outlying regions. Suku and Komoro are in a heavy flood warning throughout the night."
"Trains through the region are cancelled until further notice..."
//(Audio: Living room audio faded news broadcast.)
MC::
I blink.
Wait. Is this Japan? I'm no expert but those names sound like they might be real places.
Whelp, I think we can officially mark this as not my idea...
I listen absentmindedly to the weather as I peel open the bento.
//(Plastic Opening Sounds)
So, at least some of this world isn't fabricated by my own brain. I don't have detailed information of Japan. The real question is if the techs took the extra effort for realism? 
Maybe to make the transition easier for my already addled grey matter? 
Interesting hypothesis. Shirobi was very clear though. The test would be both sterile and very mundane. 
A burst of flavor: pickled fish eggs, brings me back to my dinner. Holy shit! This is so good! For being just convenient store pickings, it's incredibly high quality food!
The bento even had some cute little chopsticks taped on the inside of the lid! 
Chuckling a bit, I scoop up some rice.
News Broadcaster::
"Isesaki is currently under a severe storm warning until 3am tonight. Everyone is advised to remain at home and lock your doors and windows."
"Localized flooding is being reported throughout the southern district. Now, back to the news!"
MC::
The map!
I get up a bit too quickly, dizziness overtaking me. Steadying myself, I go to the kitchen counter to snatch the map. 
It's written in Japanese. Again: I can read it clearly.
Frowning is becoming a thing for me. 
I open the map. 
Isesaki? That's where I'm at? 
Sitting on the couch, I study the map carefully. Going to have to go outside tommorow and find my house on here.  
Odd. There are no roads leading <i>out</i> of the city? The rest of the map is blank?
Chewing on the sushi, I run my fingers down the main roads, searching for a possible exit. Yep, none lead out. They just stop.
Misprint? 
Folding the map carefully to ensure I don't get food juices on it, I place it back down on the coffee table.
//(audio: audio clicking remote)
Click.
Click.
HMMM...
Click.
Same channel.
Japanese Ramen Commercial... Bubble Gum Ramen?!
I have only <i>one</i> channel.
//(Sigh)
MC, this is already more than you expected.
There was supposed to be a white room with Shirobi probing you. That's it. 
Yet... I feel more like I'm on vacation. 
Getting up, I turn off the TV. Time for a bath, and then I should work on the pc. 
6pm? Plenty of time for a bath. 
//(audio: toilet flushing, sounds of water and brushing teeth.)
MC::
Much better!
I don't even question that my old toothbrush is in the bathroom. Nope!
I have no issues finding suitable underwear and clothes in my room. It still baffles me that clothes are even provided with such detail. The pajamas are from my house in the real world too!
"I can get used to this."
I put my dirty clothes in the hamper near the washer. Tommorow. I promise. 
Barefoot, with a canned coffee in hand, I head to my bedroom for the night. It's been a good day.
Doubt festers in the back of my head, and I promptly shove it down. I've no answers. There's no sense worrying about it now. I'm alive and seem to not be degrading. 
No issues concentrating. I don't seem to be in mortal danger right now. Plus, I don't mind taking a break from college. 
//(Background : MC Bedroom, Computer desk. Sounds: Putting a cup down and sitting down. Music Playing on PC)
Now the PC. 
Ha, I completely forgot the music was still playing. 
I spent the entire day pointedly ignoring it. It's my lifeline to the real world. 
What if I can't talk to the techs though?
{if: Male Check PC, true}
{
    MC::
    I lean back and look at the lan cable slot on the wall.
    "Fuck. Almost forgot."
    I stand up, checking the back of the pc. I see a blue lan cable connects to the wall and leads to the back.
    I lean forward, almost brushing my head against the monitor. I can barely see it, but there are lights flashing.
    It's talking to <i>something</i>. The damn lights are blinking right? That's what that means? 
    //(audio: Creak of the chair)
    I lean back in the chair, and type in my password.
    Odd: It wasn't working earlier today. What changed? 
    The implications. I can't ignore this. The world is changing around me, and without me interacting with it. Or <i>someone</i> fixed it while I was gone.
    Is there a problem with this server? The rain outside, the NPCs. 
    Only one way to test!
    //(Audio: Keyboard typing)
    Goggles is up, let's do a tried and true search test.
    "Gothic anime titties."
    Results pop up! Successful test!
}
MC::
{if: Male Check PC, false}
{
    I move the mouse and input my amazing password:
    milf69UwU.
}
First thing I do is pause the music. 
This should be easy peasy. Let's give Shirobi a report. I'm sure he has been gnawing away at his finger nails all day. 
I go to the browser, typing in the IP address that he forced me to memorize, and hit enter. It freezes and I wait. 
HMMM. Yes the IP is the one I memorized. I didn't mistype. A password box should pop up. 
//(tapping finger on table)
Ok 30 seconds is up, lets refresh and try again. 
As I sip my coffee, the caramel notes hit my taste buds just right. YUM. 
I should probably get some ground coffee next run. 
404. IP address not found. 
Fine!
Speed test! It pops over 1 gigabyte a second. That is the fastest internet I have personally seen.
Youbtube.com and click.
//(youbtube video playing)
Yep, video loads right up. I'm online. But...
Let's check if there is any news about the test? 
'Digitization is a Success!', and headlines like, 'Silence deafening at Digital Horizons.' cover the first page of search. It looks like they are all using the same source information.
Oh a video!
And I watch myself go limp, with slobber coming out of my mouth. 
(chuckling that slowly turns nervous)
Yeah I look <i>horrible</i>. Is that what I looked like? In front of billions of people?!
Well, at least they were gentle with my body. Gives me the chills watching people carrying it away to who knows where.
I know the Sup, Cliff, well enough, and he looks a bit tense. Ah, probably just the pressure of being live. 
The video cuts off abruptly without any explanation. News reporters mention the lab cut the feed.
Digital Horizons states it was for the privacy and protection of industry secrets.  Well thanks you guys. No help there. 
Yet, the official server connection is down. I can't access the messaging system for the experiment. I appear to have full access to the internet but...
I open up Dischordz. I do have Shirobi on here at least. 
//(audio: discord sounds and typing)
I randomly pick a server. People are chatting! I go to Shirobi's DM history and send a standard greeting to him.
'Hey Shitstain! I'm full of sushi and chilling with some canned caramel coffee! Thanks for the distractions but the official server is down. What do I do?'
//(one click)
Nothing happens.
Odd, its giving the same animations that you get in slow mode. 
I hit enter again. Nothing. I quickly pop over to a vtuber's server I frequent. I type hi and hit send. 
Blocked animation again. 
Sweat hits the keyboard. I'm sweating? I touch my forehead lightly, wiping the layer of moisture off with two fingers. 
This can't be copied. These are actual people I know. Digital Horizons, nor Shirobi, have any clue which servers on Dischordz I chill in. 
These are channels that are live and online right now. The actual internet. 
And... I can't reach out. I can't touch the world. It's like a pane of glass blocking me from the real world. 
// (Audio: Typing)
My email!
I send a really dumb "Help meh!" message to Shirobi on his personal email. Two seconds later, it comes up as undeliverable.
A handful of those npcs at Lawsons looked kind of like Vtubers.
And those piercing eyes that bore into my soul...
//(audio: can hitting table)
I chug some coffee and slam the can down. 
Based on all the information I have now, there's really only <i>one</i> logical conclusion. 
I'm not on the local server. I'm in the internet. 
They <i>Digitized</i> me into the mainstream internet. 
MC::
//(all audio stops)
"Fuck."
//(audio: Heartbeat)
I lean forward, rubbing my temples with both hands. That means that Digital Horizons has absolutely <i>NO</i> idea where I am. None.
That also means that no one's going to be able to contact me via normal methods. I'm here, completely disconnected from my own body. 
I am, in essence, a program myself.  I'm alone. 
I push down my panic. 
The house, the city, the birds. Who are they? Better yet? Where the fuck am I?
The map. No city limits, no roads out of town. Does that actually mean there are <i>no</i> roads out? 
Then how do you leave? 
I look up the city I'm in on the web. Sure enough, it's a real place. 
"Do you think those eyes belonged to a real person? Or an AI?"
The fear tinges my tone heavily. 
There are tons of AI Vtubers now. What if some of those lore videos were accurate? I'm vulnerable. I can't just log out. 
With sythgens basically taking over vtubing, some are actually real AI that live here. I'm sure they would be just roleplaying as humans, but why?
Money to maintain servers sure, but some AI are nested in the new internet we have. 
There was never confirmation that Projekt Melody was a real human being. She's still streaming. 
Her voice hasn't changed at all in the 20 years either. You would figure people would age and move on. 
Those eyes. If that was an AI, the focus on me hinted that they might <i>know</i> that I am here in the 'flesh.'
If only I could talk to an expert on this. Do I stick out like a sore thumb to the right programs? 
Are they the enemy? Or would they be willing to help me get back?
I stare at the monitor. What was once just streams on a screen, are now breathing, walking, eating, <i>'people'</i>. Anxiety starts to well up inside me again. I have to be very careful on who I contact until I know more. 
I go to the twatch server website and pull up my subs page. 
All of my favorite VTubers within arms reach? It can be a double edge sword instantly.
//(Sigh)
Ok. Tommorow, I need to head to that train station and see if it's functional. Maybe even take a trip outside of this city. 
Maybe I can find some answers. Until then? Some coffee, and some streams. 
I just want to feel normal again...

    For a sliver of time, MC forgets he's in an alien world. He forgets the stresses of the day, and the implications of that information.
    He relaxes, laughing as he watches some of his favorite streamers; Asterella Star, Fefe, and Kota are streaming tonight. 
    Every once in a while, you notice his typing on the keyboard, and the tortured sigh that escapes MC when he remembers he cannot interact. After a few times, he pushes the keyboard back and just watches. 
    Outside, the rain continues to pour down, lightening raking the sky like a tesla coil. 
    Back in the real world, Shirobi lays on his bed, looking the worse for wear. Still in his lab coat, he taps on his cellphone screen. 
    A tired yawn escapes his lips.
    His pc is on. On the monitor, it's searching for something, indexing billions of code per second.
    {change background to Lab}
    Inside the lab, quiet reigns. The lights are on night mode, with only the glare of screens breaking the darkness. 
    In the supervisor's office sits Cliff, nursing a shotglass of whiskey. He already called home to let his family know he won't be coming home.
    They're used to it by now. 
    Cliff is pouring over a staff report, looking absolutely defeated. He swirls the ice in his shotglass.
