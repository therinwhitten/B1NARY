Pain. So much pain!
Ground? Ground!
{anim: EyeBlink, Close}
Ceiling..
{anim: EyeBlink, Open}
Not <i>my</i> ceiling. 
{anim: EyeBlink, Open}
It's a very nice ceiling though. 
{anim: EyeBlink, DefaultOpen}
More importantly, it means that I'm <i>alive</i>.
Why does it look familiar? 
{disablechar: EyeBlink}
The music is nice. 
I can see again, and the pain is easing pretty quick. 
Maybe it's just a shock to my nervous system?  
Hmmmm...
I may be overthinking this, if I am just digital here, then did my my brain create this body?
I blink again to remove any residual blurriness in my vision, and look down at my chest.
I'm not naked. Why did I think I <i>would</i> be?
Casual Saturday clothes. My favorite anime shirt, worn from overuse, and my most comfy pair of blue jeans. 
Laying on my back...
The carpet is soft and thick. I could sleep here!
Groaning a bit, I look around, mentally trying to still the sudden twitches from muscles protesting. 
Simple room: the layout looks very familiar somehow.
The carpet I am crumpled on (I am feeling like a slab of meat right now) is not across the whole room from my vantage point. 
I spy a wooden floor near the door of the bedroom, polished from age. 
I crane my neck to see the other side of the room, beyond the window. 
UGH
Blurry vision greets me. Nausea deep in the pit of my belly awakens. I blink again.
There is a desk. 
A simple one: dorm style with a small reading lamp and some managa on the bookcase. 
Wait...
That is <i>my</i> PC on the desk. That is fricken odd. 
It's my PC from home. Same monitor, even the stickers on the case are the same.
Nice details Devs!
They really went out of their way! Looks like the test server is set up to keep me comfy. 
You won't find me complaining. 
The air is crisp and cool on my skin. I smell ozone, as if there was just a rain storm. 
Window's open. 
Now that I think about it, the lab guys are probably stalking me right now while slurping up some ramen. 
Shirobi is definitely scarfing down some cup of noodle. 
The tension that I didn't even realize is there starts to fade. 
That's probably why the computer is there. It allows me a familiar way to communicate with them.
Can they actually read my mind right now?  Maybe I will avoid doing more questionable things while I am here? 
'Hey Shirobi, your taste in manga is trash!'
"(heh heh heh)"
Focus! I am getting paid for this. I think.
I need to get to my feet...slowly.
Ok MC, sit up. That is your first mission.
My vision lurches suddenly. I can sit up. 
UP!
Sitting up, everything feels <i>real</i>! I know I'm looking for bugs or errors right now. Maybe that's why I have a nagging sense of panic rising in my chest.
Edgy would be the best way to describe it. Red alarm bells keep  attacking my groggy attention span. 
Later. I have things to do. I have a laundry list of things I was told to memorize. I did get through almost all of them.
The first one is the steps to establish contact with Shirobi back at the lab. 
"Frick." 
I can't help it.  As I try to stand, my whole body spikes with pins and needles like an wave. 
//(Standing up Audio)
Nice. I am now standing! Good job me!
"Ummmm..."
That red alarm bell gets louder...
They told me it would be just me. No AI, NPCs, nothing.
The first steps were to conduct a batch of tests on my behavior, changes to my brain patterns, and my overall capacity of perspective.
Sterile...
Sterile...
//(Background music change and maybe change of scene)
I immediately head for the open window.
The smell of ozone was stronger here. A storm <i>is</i> coming in. 
I am on the second floor, with an enclosed yard. Beyond the brick and mortar fence, I see a road and other houses on the other side. 
No cars or foot traffic. The signs I see are in Japanese.
If I didn't know any better, this is a snapshot of a slice of live anime!
Why? Why does this feel so real? I know this place? 
//(Chirp)
Wait what is that?
//(Chirp)
The alarm bells in my head are clanging with a deafening roar now.  And then, I see them. 
Birds. Just birds. Maybe warblers? Just doing normal bird things.
Sterile...
I shove the alarm bells to a muted corner of my mind. Think!
Hahaha. Just fucking birds! Nothing to worry about at all!
I listen closer, straining my ears. 
Do I hear cars far off?  Forested hills dot the horizon, the dark, ominous storm clouds peeking over the hills to the west. 
Sterile...
They told me the server would be a blank slate. What exactly did they mean by sterile?  Wouldn't those birds <i>be</i> NPCs? 
If I had to make a guess, this area looks like upper middle class suburb in Japan, based on the anime I have watched. 
That computer is my personal pc too. 
I tap my chin thoughtfully.
So maybe my mind is showing things that gives me comfort? Is this my brain trying to prevent me from panicking? 
If this was a completely sterile white room with no input, would my mind break? 
If memory serves, I did sleep through parts of orientation on a regular basis. I <i>think</i> I would've remembered something that serious though.
I can hear him now.
Shirobi::
"Residual self awareness will be prominent across the spectrum of (random babbling I didnt listen to) but theoretically, it should be minor in scope."
MC::
What I got from that lecture was  that my mind is only able to alter things a little bit. Like a pc here <i>looking</i> like mine from home. You know things like that. 
Not a whole town!
//(Birbs sounds fading)
I shut the window and glance over at "my" PC.
//(Stomach rumbling)
Blood rushes to my face.
That was the loudest my stomach has ever growled for food. It was as if it remembers how to digest now. 
//(Loud Laugh)
If it was an anime, it would be a very normal thing to do when hungry.
I am hungry though. 
Decisions, decisions.
My hunger can wait. I won't die, I think.
Establishing comms with the Lab Team should be the first priority. 
Already checking my jeans for my wallet (it's there) I open it up to find enough for a while. 
The money's in Yen, but it looks like alot. 
Should I go to the kitchen to see if I can scrounge up some food, or maybe go to a store?
The store option would allow me to get a better handle on my location...
Why would they go this far for the test?
So...
{choice: What do I do?}
{
    No food. Food is for the weak!
    [
        {setbool: Male Check PC, true}
        Shirobi will be mad if I don't respond soon...
        Time is important here. There is an entire team waiting to hear back from me. 
        //(Change Scene to Infront of PC)
        //(Audio of chair being pulled out)
        I pull the chair out, gazing at the monitor. My monitor. This music be bussin. 
        It is from my playlists at home, after all.
        Now that I think about it, they shouldn't be capable of replicating music I don't remember the lyrics to from my memory.
        Yes, I did pay attention <i>just</i> a bit. A tiny, tiny bit.
        //(Typewriter clicking and mouse clicks)
        Whelp... Input my password from home? What was it?
        Oh yeah!
        milf69UwU
        There!
        "We're in..."
        //(stomache growl sounds)
        Ok.. browser is up now. Shirobi made me memorize the IP address.
        The IP address is to a closed server where I can log all of my issues and impressions. Kind of like a diary, as they explain it.
        //(Typeclicking sounds)
        They also slapped an app in a folder that I install for direct messaging to the real world. Let's see. 
        The IP address is now in the browser.
        ENTER
        Hmmm. Blank screen? 
        (frowns)
        F5
        404 Error 
        ?
        The LAN cable <i>can't</i> be disconnected when they literally got my PC down to even the background...
        Ok. Let's try some Brand X or Goggles. 
        Nothing.
        //(nervous laugh bursting out)
        No connection to the lab techs? Something is broken here. The servers really aren't attached to the internet, but I should be connected to the local network, at least.
        Don't. Panic. You haven't tried everything yet.
        {changeScript: Male/Denizen/Male Domain, 116}
    ]
    I'm starving! Grab something fast from the kitchen.
    [
        {setbool: maleatepickle, true}
        Maybe just a touch of food, if there is any in the house. Will only take a few minutes.
        Besides, exploring where I fell makes sense. And might find some food at the same time. 
        I don't even know how food works here? Do I have to poop? 
        What is poop here? 
        I blanche a bit. 
        Yeah let's not think about it <i>that</i> hard. Let the techs do all that heavy lifting.  
        //(Footsteps audio and doorknob sound)
        I grab the doorknob, half fearful it wouldn't feel real. 
        Metal, cool to the touch. 
        I take a deep breath and turn the knob...
        Pulling quietly as I possibly can, I peek through the crack. I have no idea what to expect at all. Will there only be a form of blank space?
        Could aliens be behind this door? Wearing straw hats, lab coats and holding clip boards smacking a medical gurney?
        Or perhaps they would order me to strip first?
        //(Player chuckles)
        Maybe I am going too far here. Things have been completely normal. Too normal. It fills me with anxiety. 
        It's not <i>supposed</i> to be normal at all! 
        I am a collection of a human thoughts translated to digital code and held together by a "soul." I was <i>told</i> that this server would not be normal at all. 
        Normal, nor pleasant.
        And yet...it's nice here. I don't feel weird at all.
        //(Stomache grumbling)
        Except that. <i>That</i> is not normal for me. I am so frickin hungry.
        Well, the hallway looks comfy enough; a wide hallway of polished wood flooring, an amber strip of dense carpet leading the way to the stairs. 
        My fear dwindling somewhat, I step out into the hallway.
        Those stairs lead down to the first floor at the end of the hallway to the left. I see two more doors. If I had to guess, another bedroom and maybe a bathroom? 
        I am not sure how I know, but I know for sure that is what they are. 
        I just know. The alarm bells start going off a bit again. I feel at home in this house. Why?
        There are two bedrooms on this floor. On the first floor: a kitchen, a large bath, a living room, and a laundry room.
        Steeling my nerves, I start moving, making a beeline for the stairs. 
        //(footsteps audio and PC music fades)
        I knew it.
        At the base of the stairs stood a clean wooden foyer, with a traditional Japanese Genkan where you leave your shoes at. Off to my right is the living room and kitchen. Main bath and toilet is behind these stairs to the right.
        Just like the floor plan is in my head. 
        It has to be. My mind made this house. An inprint of some sort? Maybe it's ties to my perception...
        I wonder if other people see this house the same way?
        I frown, finding myself instinctively walking to the kitchen.
        The lectures I sat in covered this, it was theoretically possible. It's one of the tests I was supposed to conduct. 
        Does the brain 'create' the world as you move? Or does it already exist? Where does the code of the world and the perspective of the mind merge?
        //(Steps stop)
        What a nice kitchen. 
        Stainless steel pots and pans hang over the center prep area (contrary to popular belief, I, a loner college student, love to cook. It's one of my passions).
        I smile to myself. Heading over to the fridge, I hesistate just at the point where I open it...
        Moment of truth. There is a 50 percent chance of actual food being in here. I swallow audibly and open the door. 
        ...
        ...
        What?
        Pickles on the door, cans of cola, a carton of milk, tomatoes in the crisper, otherwise pretty much an empty fridge. <i>Just like an anime...</i>
        Really?!
        I grab the pickle jar. I am <i>not</i> eating a tomato like an apple. I am not that hungry yet. 
        //(pickle jar opening)
        I fish for a good one. I shouldn't get my hopes up. There will probably be no taste and the texture will probably be flat.
        //(Crunching noises)
        ?
        It tastes awesome! The moment my teeth bite down on the skin, the flavors pop. My stomach grumbles in relentless impatience as true hunger kicks in. 
        The pickle stood no chance. I inhale it in two bites. 
        Nice! I can eat here, and it doesn't taste like chewing on paper! That will make this test much easier but...
        I am <i>not</i> eating a tomato and pickle sandwich. 
        Would there, perhaps, maybe, possibly be a store I could go buy some ramen from?
        Just the notion of actually walking to a store for more food here triggers a very panic filled thought...
        I snatch a can of cola, closing the fridge door softly.
        //(closing fridge door sound : opening soda can sounds)
        As I take swig of soda, from the corner of my eye I notice a coffee pot (k cup type), food dehydrator, and a knife block with high quality cooking tools. 
        Top of the line glass top stove, and microwave combo. It's like my dream kitchen! I can definitely get used to this!
        Ok. Let's see. 
        I pull my wallet out. 
        No debit cards, and Japanese ID, I assume? And alot of Yen.
        Wow, 300k in Yen. How much is that exactly? Will have to look up the exchange rate?
        Finding a store in a sterile server...
        Chugging the rest of the Cola (it's not bad), I walk towards the genkan, tossing the can into the recycle bin. Really, why don't we have these more often in the United States?
        And, right in front of the wooden floor with a corner table. Right on top was a cordless phone, and a set of house keys. Just like I imagined there <i>would</i> be.
        Yeah, I think it's safe to say my imagination is creating this house. The big question that I am trying to avoid is: Am I still in the sterile server we planned? Or somewhere else?
        //(MC Sighs)
        I grab the keys, pocket them, placing my shoes on. 
        And with that, I head outside into the "Real World."
        {changeScript: Male/Denizen/Male Domain Lawsons}
    ]
    Too lazy, want to see what's out there. Lets go on a walk!
    [
        {setbool: maleatepickle, false}
        Shirobi can wait. I would like to have more information before I face him.
        I am having issues focusing anyway.
        With money in my wallet, I <i>know</i> the house keys are near the exit of the house. Somehow I do.
        Grabbing the doorknob, the cool metal reaffirming reality a bit for me, I take a deep breath to steady my nerves and turn...
        I am trying to be ninja quiet here, peeking through the slit of an opening. I expected empty space, maybe a random group of aliens there to anal probe me, but nope.
        //(Vince Chuckling)
        My fricken brain man. 
        Things feel normal so far. Which, by itself, fills me with a form of low level dread, expecting a surprise around each corner. This place is not supposed to be normal at all. 
        I am a walking, self-aware digital signal, after all.  I <i>was</i> told this server would not feel real, or pleasant.
        And yet, it's nice here. I woke up in a calm room in a comfy house. It's like I was teleported to... ANOTHER WORLD.
        //(Stomach Grumbles)
        Except that. That is not normal for me at all. An anime trope. 
        As I pop my head into the hallway, I gasp a bit.
        There are two more doors, which I somehow know are another bedroom and a small bathroom. 
        The polished wooden floor and carpet, it's all familiar to me. 
        I just know! It's a bit disturbing. I know downstairs has a laundry room, a living room, a kitchen, a full bath, and a Japanese-style genken.
        Let's get this over with. 
        //(sounds: Opening the door, and walking on carpet)
        I make a beeline for the stairs and down the steps. 
        //(PC Music Fades)
        At the base of the stairs, it is exactly how I imagine it in my head. A clean, wooden foyer called a genkan.  Kitchen and living room are directly to my right. The main bath and laundry room are behind the stairs to the right.
        This confirms it. This house is built by my mind. An imprint of some sort? Have I seen this layout before?
        As I stand there, I reach for my wallet, taking in exactly what I have. 
        My curret ID in Japanese, about 300k Yen (What's the exhange rate?), a few cards I don't exactly recognize, and a keyring?
        My eyes drift to the nightstand right in front of the genkan. There are the house keys, next to the cordless phone.
        //(Vincent Sighs)
        I grab the keys, and pocket them while slipping on my shoes. 
        The alarm bells are ringing louder, but I choose to ignore them. 
        The more time I look around, the more I am coming to accept that I might not be in the test server.
        And with that I head outside.
