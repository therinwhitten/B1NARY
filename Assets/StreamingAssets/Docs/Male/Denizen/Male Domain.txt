MC::
Pain. So much pain!
Ground? Ground!
(Blink animation)
Ceiling...
Not <i>my</i> ceiling. 
It's a very nice ceiling though. 
More importantly, it means that I'm <i>alive</i>.
Why does it look familiar? 
The music is nice. 
I can see again, and the pain is easing pretty quick. 
Maybe it's just a shock to my nervous system?  
Hmmmm...
I may be overthinking this, if I am just digital here, then did my my brain create this body?
I blink again to remove any residual blurriness in my vision, and look down at my chest.
I'm not naked. Why did I think I <i>would</i> be?
Casual Saturday clothes. My favorite anime shirt, worn from overuse, and my most comfy pair of blue jeans. 
Laying on my back...
The carpet is soft and thick. I could sleep here!
Groaning a bit, I look around, mentally trying to still the sudden twitches from muscles protesting. 
Simple room: the layout looks very familiar somehow.
The carpet I am crumpled on (I am feeling like a slab of meat right now) is not across the whole room from my vantage point. 
I spy a wooden floor near the door of the bedroom, polished from age. 
I crane my neck to see the other side of the room, beyond the window. 
UGH
Blurry vision greets me. Nausea deep in the pit of my belly awakens. I blink again.
There is a desk. 
A simple one: dorm style with a small reading lamp and some managa on the bookcase. 
Wait...
That is <i>my</i> PC on the desk. That is fricken odd. 
It's my PC from home. Same monitor, even the stickers on the case are the same.
Nice details Devs!
They really went out of their way! Looks like the test server is set up to keep me comfy. 
You won't find me complaining. 
The air is crisp and cool on my skin. I smell ozone, as if there was just a rain storm. 
Window's open. 
Now that I think about it, the lab guys are probably stalking me right now while slurping up some ramen. 
Shirobi is definitely scarfing down some cup of noodle. 
The tension that I didn't even realize is there starts to fade. 
That's probably why the computer is there. It allows me a familiar way to communicate with them.
Can they actually read my mind right now?  Maybe I will avoid doing more questionable things while I am here? 
'Hey Shirobi, your taste in manga is trash!'
"(heh heh heh)"
Focus! I am getting paid for this. I think.
I need to get to my feet...slowly.
Ok MC, sit up. That is your first mission.
My vision lurches suddenly. I can sit up. 
UP!
Sitting up, everything feels <i>real</i>! I know I'm looking for bugs or errors right now. Maybe that's why I have a nagging sense of panic rising in my chest.
Edgy would be the best way to describe it. Red alarm bells keep  attacking my groggy attention span. 
Later. I have things to do. I have a laundry list of things I was told to memorize. I did get through almost all of them.
The first one is the steps to establish contact with Shirobi back at the lab. 
"Frick." 
I can't help it.  As I try to stand, my whole body spikes with pins and needles like an wave. 
//(Standing up Audio)
Nice. I am now standing! Good job me!
"Ummmm..."
That red alarm bell gets louder...
They told me it would be just me. No AI, NPCs, nothing.
The first steps were to conduct a batch of tests on my behavior, changes to my brain patterns, and my overall capacity of perspective.
Sterile...
Sterile...
//(Background music change and maybe change of scene)
I immediately head for the open window.
The smell of ozone was stronger here. A storm <i>is</i> coming in. 
I am on the second floor, with an enclosed yard. Beyond the brick and mortar fence, I see a road and other houses on the other side. 
No cars or foot traffic. The signs I see are in Japanese.
If I didn't know any better, this is a snapshot of a slice of live anime!
Why? Why does this feel so real? I know this place? 
//(Chirp)
Wait what is that?
//(Chirp)
The alarm bells in my head are clanging with a deafening roar now.  And then, I see them. 
Birds. Just birds. Maybe warblers? Just doing normal bird things.
Sterile...
I shove the alarm bells to a muted corner of my mind. Think!
Hahaha. Just fucking birds! Nothing to worry about at all!
I listen closer, straining my ears. 
Do I hear cars far off?  Forested hills dot the horizon, the dark, ominous storm clouds peeking over the hills to the west. 
Sterile...
They told me the server would be a blank slate. What exactly did they mean by sterile?  Wouldn't those birds <i>be</i> NPCs? 
If I had to make a guess, this area looks like upper middle class suburb in Japan, based on the anime I have watched. 
That computer is my personal pc too. 
I tap my chin thoughtfully.
So maybe my mind is showing things that gives me comfort? Is this my brain trying to prevent me from panicking? 
If this was a completely sterile white room with no input, would my mind break? 
If memory serves, I did sleep through parts of orientation on a regular basis. I <i>think</i> I would've remembered something that serious though.
I can hear him now.
Shirobi::
"Residual self awareness will be prominent across the spectrum of (random babbling I didnt listen to) but theoretically, it should be minor in scope."
MC::
What I got from that lecture was  that my mind is only able to alter things a little bit. Like a pc here <i>looking</i> like mine from home. You know things like that. 
Not a whole town!
//(Birbs sounds fading)
I shut the window and glance over at "my" PC.
//(Stomach rumbling)
Blood rushes to my face.
That was the loudest my stomach has ever growled for food. It was as if it remembers how to digest now. 
//(Loud Laugh)
If it was an anime, it would be a very normal thing to do when hungry.
I am hungry though. 
Decisions, decisions.
My hunger can wait. I won't die, I think.
Establishing comms with the Lab Team should be the first priority. 
Already checking my jeans for my wallet (it's there) I open it up to find enough for a while. 
The money's in Yen, but it looks like alot. 
Should I go to the kitchen to see if I can scrounge up some food, or maybe go to a store?
The store option would allow me to get a better handle on my location...
Why would they go this far for the test?
So...
{choice: What do I do?}
{
    No food. Food is for the weak!
    [
        Shirobi will be mad if I don't respond soon...
        Time is important here. There is an entire team waiting to hear back from me. 
        //(Change Scene to Infront of PC)
        //(Audio of chair being pulled out)
        I pull the chair out, gazing at the monitor. My monitor. This music be bussin. 
        It is from my playlists at home, after all.
        Now that I think about it, they shouldn't be capable of replicating music I don't remember the lyrics to from my memory.
        Yes, I did pay attention <i>just</i> a bit. A tiny, tiny bit.
        //(Typewriter clicking and mouse clicks)
        Whelp... Input my password from home? What was it?
        Oh yeah!
        milf69UwU
        There!
        "We're in..."
        //(stomache growl sounds)
        Ok.. browser is up now. Shirobi made me memorize the IP address.
        The IP address is to a closed server where I can log all of my issues and impressions. Kind of like a diary, as they explain it.
        //(Typeclicking sounds)
        They also slapped an app in a folder that I install for direct messaging to the real world. Let's see. 
        The IP address is now in the browser.
        ENTER
        Hmmm. Blank screen? 
        (frowns)
        F5
        404 Error 
        ?
        The LAN cable <i>can't</i> be disconnected when they literally got my PC down to even the background...
        Ok. Let's try some Bitter or Goggles. 
        


    ]
    I'm starving! Grab something fast from the kitchen.
    [
        Maybe just a touch of food, if there is any in the house. Will only take a few minutes.
    ]
    Too lazy, want to see what's out there. Lets go on a walk!
    [
        Shirobi can wait. I would like to have more information before I face him.
