Narrator::
Knight, I set up the animations with different audio sources so you can see in the mixer how it works. 
What I need is this: 
1. Audio in each animation loop repeats RANDOMLY while still playing. (Repeat on repeats the random one it selected.)
2. Both Channels need to play at the same time. It always chooses the lowest in the heirchy when playing audio. 
I expect us to have Speech, body sounds, and another person speaking all playing at the same time. 
I only added audio to angry, impatient and smug. 
Scene can be found in Test Scenes Folder
Good Luck!
