Haru::
Hey I don't have a character. But I talk like magic......
<i>Looks around pensively</i>
Hmmm maybe I should have a body. 
{spawnChar: haru, .75}
Ah there I am! That was kinda scary. 
{moveChar: haru, .25}
I guess I should be happy that I am even here. 
Xplicit wants me to test shit out, so here we go.
OMG Expressions are not working!
Ok so in default scene, no expressions, animation control. 
Which is odd considering I am still trying to figure this out. And I really want to write in the game. Its kinda frustrating not knowing why something isn't working.
