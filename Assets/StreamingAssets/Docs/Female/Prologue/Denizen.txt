No body, yet there is a direction.
No motion, yet the sensation of forward progression...
Like falling down a waterfall, right before you hit terminal velocity.
A waterfall through a straw... if there is such a thing.
"It's so... peaceful."
No words come out. I have no lungs.
All the fears, the press room, everything, fades away...
Right now. Right now is what matters. 
No human has ever experienced this. No one. 
My heartbeat thumps loudly, even though I don't think I have a body.
Nausea hits quickly as I lurch to the side.
Nausea? Here?
I have no stomach...
Confusion, yes. The implications though...
Speed picks up. I feel excitement rise up in my "chest."
"So, this is what it feels like to travel through a cable..."
That must be this sensation.
There is no sound, but I don't really care. 
No sound because I currently have no ears to hear them with.
What if I did?
What would I hear?
{additive: on}
Time has no power here either.
I feel it.
<i>I know it.</i>
{additive: off}
The trip will probably be over in the blink of an eye.
It feels like it has already been several minutes.
{fadeinsound: Brain Sucking Chair Activate, 1}
Force erupts.
My brain jolts.
No pain, but my brain feels like it starts to tear apart.
I tear up in fear.
What was that?!
Will I simply cease to be? 
Not even able to see what is on the other side?
"You can't take this away from me!"
With all my will, I focus. <i>Hard.</i>
I simply refuse: force my brain to form cohesion.
Another shift, more violent than before.
I almost lose it.
I am <i>me</i>!
I run through memories of the past, of my family, my school, my childhood friends.
I refuse to allow myself to fade.
The pressure on me is enormous.
If I still had a mouth, I would be laughing incoherently.
Everything is separating, and combining at the same time. 
"HOLD TOGETHER."
