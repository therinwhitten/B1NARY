MC::
No body, yet there is a direction.
No motion, yet the sensation of forward motion.
Like falling down a waterfall, right before you hit terminal velocity.
A waterfall through a straw.....if there is such a thing.
"It is so......peaceful."
No words come out. I have no lungs.
My heartbeat thumps loudly, even though I don't think I have a body.
Nausea hits fast, as I suddenly lurch to the side.
Speed picks up. I feel excitement rise up in my "chest."
"So this is what it feels like to travel through a cable...."
This has to be this sensation.
{additive: on}
Time has no power here.
I feel it.
I KNOW IT.
{additive: off}
The trip will probably be in the blink of an eye.
It feels like it has already been several minutes.

Force erupts.
My brain jolts.
No pain, but my brain starts to tear apart.
I tear up in fear.
Will I simply cease to be? Not even able to see what is on the other side?
"NOOOOOO!"
With all of my will, I focus. HARD.
I simply refuse. Force my brain to form cohesion.
Another shift, more violent than before.
I almost lose it.
I am ME!
If I did have a mouth, I would be laughing incoherently.
"HOLD TOGETHER."
