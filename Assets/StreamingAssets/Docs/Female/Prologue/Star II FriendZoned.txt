[Confusion]
MC::
"I'm sorry Star, I don't feel comfortable with this."
MC, why? 
{additive:on}
Because, 
you just got here! 
You don't know her, 
or the situation you're in.
That's why!
{additive:off} 
Asterella sits up straight, masking her disappointment.
Asterella::
[Happy]
"Welp, that was unexpected, but ok."
"We can still talk."
[Default]
Narrator::
Throughout the night, talk consisted of boys, games, and different things they loved to stream.
It was a girl's night out pajama party, and Lucas soon joined them later to play some card games. 
Being Friendzoned doesn't have to be a bad thing. 
There may be times where it can benefit your situation. 
Other times, you might just get one of the "bad endings."
Well... what are you waiting for?
Get back to the H scene already!
Enjoy the rest of the demo. XD
