With desperation, I shove all that is me back into my head.
{additive: on}
Eyesight blurring, tears welling up, 
I lay on my back. 
{additive: off}
Long, deep breaths.
Awareness of my body returns as the panic of my brain splitting subsides.
I feel pain with no source, spasms harassing my muscles. 
Don't move. Not yet. 
A light breeze buffets me, warm and gentle. 
I crack my eyes open carefully, pain jabs me in the pupils.
"Why?"
My voice sounds hoarse, and a bit whiny. 
I place my forearm over my eyes and focus on my breathing. 
I notice moonlight. 
Bright moonlight. 
Moonlight?
I peer beyond the bottom of my forearm at the pale light spilling onto my body, and the surrounding vegetation.
I feel moisture soaking my back. 
Dew?
The rustle of grass as I move focuses my mind even more. 
I move my arm away from my eyes.
{additive:on}
The largest moon I have ever seen dominates the night sky.
I can clearly see the surface, with details popping out at me. 
It's so close, I can almost touch it.
{additive:off} 
"It's so beautiful!"
Unbridling awe fills my voice.
Where... am... I?
I tense my stomach and pull myself up, much to the doggedly protest of my body. 
I am sitting in a field, tall grass surrounding me. 
The view takes my ability to speak coherently.
I did not expect this.
This is <i>not</i> the test server. 
{additive: on}
The test server was going to be a sterile environment. 
Shirobi even told me that it may look like a white room. 
{additive: off}
In the digital world things are more pronounced, according to theory.
Perspective rules the day. 
The brain sees what it wants to see in the digital world. 
It translates what it deems comfortable. 
Nothing about this scene is familiar. 
It feels alien. My mind did not make this up, I'm sure of it. 
Getting up is a chore, but I manage.
I can't get anything done lying down. 
Besides, my butt is wet.
With the tall grass no longer impeding my view, I notice a forest of pine trees, swaying lightly in the wind.
Behind that forest, sits an impending and dark mansion.
I check again.
A Manor?
I blink twice. Just in case my "eyes" decided to play tricks on me. 
There, in the distance, sits a very large complex. 
In ancient Romanian architectural style: a large, squared off building, with jutting towers surrounding it. 
The Count's Mansion. 
"I vant to suck your bloood. Mwhah."
I laugh despite myself.

MC::
{spawnChar: Live 2D Bokeh, .5, Live 2D Bokeh}
Suddenly, two feet in front of me, stands a masked man. 
He's just there.  
Compressed air smacks me in the face. 
His body looks rigid, like an iron bar, ready to spring.
Despite myself, I take one step back.
The mask on his face, blue light glowing behind it, <i>shimmers</i> as fog seeps out.
The mask <i>is</i> his face!
Masked Punk::
[Default]
"I probably taste like Flepsi..."
MC::
I am speechless. Who is this?!

{choice: Do I kick him in the nuts?}
{
    Assert your dominance! Kick him in the nuts!
    [
       "EEEEEEKKKKK!!!!"
       MC::
       I panic, naturally.
       I send a solid kick right to his nether region. 
       {setachievement: nut_cracker}
       {fadeinsound: body punch hard, .2}
       He barely catches my foot. His grip is as solid as steel.
       He whistles in appreciation.
       Masked Punk::
       [OWO]
       {additive:on}
       "Holy <i>shit</i> woman! 
       That was one hell of a kick."
       {additive:off}
       MC::
       All my jujistu training did not pay off, not against a demon.
       And now he has my foot. 
       He drops my leg, a big grin creeping onto that mask.
       Masked Punk::
       "I can't play right now."
       "That kick is making me think twice."
       MC::
       "What's that supposed to mean?!"
       {changeScript: Female/Prologue/Star I, 154}
    ]
    Fuck that! Scream!!
    [
      "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! GET AWAY!" 
    ]
}
He screams back at me. Mockingly.
Masked Punk::
{anim: Masked Punk, Impatient Start}
{anim: Masked Punk, Impatient Loop}
"AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! Get away you scary demon!"
"OMG! You're so <i>scary</i>!"
MC::
{additive:on}
"Why are you screaming??!! 
You can't do that! 
I'm screaming!"
{additive:off}
"It's not fair!"
Masked Punk::
{anim: Masked Punk, Impatient End}
{anim: Masked Punk, Wind Idle}
[Angry]
"I thought that was a greeting from your domain!!!"
"What in the hell do you want me to do?!"
Masked Punk::
[Default]
"Anyway. What is your <i>name</i>?"
MC::
He points to his chest, like explaining to a child, slow and deliberate.
Masked Punk::
"My name is Lucas."
MC::
{changeName: Masked Punk, Lucas}
"It's MC! Now stop screaming at me!"
Lucas::
"No! You started this, you stop first!"
MC::
{fadeinsound: Lucas Breathing, .2}
{fadeinsound: Female MC Breathing, .2}
{disableChar: Live 2D Bokeh}
We both stop, huffing and puffing.  
I just got here and I'm already having to deal with something I'm not ready for.
I can't hurt this man. He's too strong. Too fast. 
It's impossible! I can't beat him. I can't even hurt him.
Squaring off, legs spread wide, we face each other.
Only several feet separate us. I feel like he can instantly catch me if he really wants to.
His stance is mockingly identical to mine. 
Like... Like this is some game I want to play!
We stare at each other for a few moments.
It feels way longer than that.
The fear, crazily enough, dissolves slowly.
The whole situation has me confused.
{additive:on}
I expected many things.
Things that <i>might</i> happen. 
Server glitches, feelings of disorientation,
even symptoms of brain pattern degradation.
{additive: off}
I did not plan on facing down a demon with a mask for a face. 
Lucas::
{anim: Lucas, Wind Idle} 
MC:: 
He relaxes his stance, a huge grin smearing his "face."
{fadeinsound: Lucas Laugh 5, .2}
{fadeoutsound: Lucas Dark, 4}
{fadeinsound: Star Piano, 4}
He suddenly starts laughing heartily.
I watch him, blinking several times, unsure what to say, or do. 
Lucas::
{spawnChar: Live 2D Bokeh, .5, Live 2D Bokeh}
{additive:on}
"Oh my God, MC.
Yo, that was awesome."
{additive:off}
"Your fucking face was priceless!"
MC::
His bellowing laugh pushes a bit more blue steam out from behind his mask. 
It's pretty unnerving.
Lucas::
"Thank you for that, MC. If I had tear ducts, I would be crying right now."
MC::
I feel my cheeks puff out in a pout. 
"Lucas?"
Lucas::
"Yeah?"
{if: n-b}
{
 MC::
 "You don't go around scaring people like that! Ok?"
}
{if: !n-b}
{
 MC::
 "You don't go about scaring women walking around at night!"
}
{disableChar: Live 2D Bokeh}
The name Lucas, I <i>do</i> know.
Like an avalanche, the recognition of the name comes crashing into my conscious thoughts.
I <i>know</i> who he is. I can't believe it though. 
I'm not on the server as planned at all. 
Now I have no clue where I am actually at.
"Domain."
I try the word carefully.
Lucas appears to be watching me mull over things. He tilts his head to the left a bit.
{spawnChar: Live 2D Bokeh, .5, Live 2D Bokeh}
Lucas::
"Wait. Wait. Wait. You know who I am, don't you?"
MC::
He puffs his chest up a bit.
Lucas::
[Lewd]
"Finally! Someone recognizes me!"
"Hell yeah, les gooooo!"
MC::
He pauses and locks eyes with me.
Lucas::
"To the manor! I mean. Uh, let's go to the manor."
[Default]
"You're technically an intruder, but you don't seem so dangerous."
MC::
"I'm certainly not dangerous. Far from it."
He motions to the manor, down the path not far off. 
Lucas::
"Come. I will take you to Star, and we will figure this all out."
{moveChar: Lucas, .3}
{movecube: .3, .2}
{fadeinsound: Walking on Gravel, 1}
MC::
He starts off at a leisurely pace, enough for a short woman to follow.
(<i>Sigh</i>)
I step in behind him. 
"Asterella Star?"
Lucas::
"Yeah, you apparently know her too. That makes things a lot easier."
{additive:on}
"She normally doesn't see people this late at night, 
but she specifically <i>requested</i> me to come get you."
{additive:off}
MC::
He looks back to ensure I'm following, with a glint of blue-lit smoke leaking out.
He turns his head back around.
Lucas::
"You don't seem to have any real power."
"Then again, you could be hiding it."
MC::
He shrugs, dismissing the train of thought. 
Lucas::
{additive:on}
"Whelp, not my problem. 
Long as you don't harm this domain, 
or Star, 
I really don't give a shit what you do."
{additive:off}
{additive:on}
"Welcome to the 69th Circle of Hell, MC.
I hope you enjoy your stay."
{additive:off}
{disableChar: Live 2D Bokeh}
MC::
The signature greeting sends shivers down my spine.
This is <i>real</i>!
Not a stream online, but-in-the-flesh real!
And Lucas is taking me to <i>the</i> Asterella Star!
Oh no! 
What do I do?!
A sudden wave of nervousness envelops me.
I have always admired her from afar.
Yes, I do stream, but I barely chat with people on a personal level. 
She is <i>huge</i> now. She has been doing this for 20 years or so.
I come back to myself, studying Lucas's back. 
This doesn't feel like a place you would stream from. 
As we near the outer wall of the huge complex: the smells, the wind, all of it.
It gives me a shock. This feels real. All too real. 
And Lucas, is he really roleplaying? Or is he...
Has he always been a demon? Or are they just into their roles in this virtual world?
We get to an entrance, the old gate opening without any external forces acting on it. 
{spawnChar: Live 2D Bokeh, .5, Live 2D Bokeh}
Lucas::
"Hey MC, you can look as we go. Plenty of time for that later."
"We need to see Star first, ok?"
MC::
{disableChar: Live 2D Bokeh}
I nod.
Who am I to disagree? He could tie me up in an instant. 
Not that I wouldn't want him to...
No. No. I don't want to be tied up! No! Stop it! Stop it player!
As we pass the ingress, my eyes are bathed in beauty.
{fadeoutsound: Walking on Gravel, 1}
{fadeinsound: waterfountainstar, 2}
{additive: on}
Lush oak and ash trees dot the landscape in a chaotic symmetry.
The wind caressing their leaves. 
The bright moonlight bathes and reflects off the black marble benches, their place painstakingly chosen.
{additive:off}
In front of the manor, sits a large fountain, the water sparkling from the moonlight. 
{spawnChar: Live 2D Bokeh, .5, Live 2D Bokeh}
Lucas::
{movecube: .5, .1}
[OWO]
"Yo! You coming?"
MC::
I realize I'm not walking. 
Standing frozen, taking in the sights, 
I only made it four feet into the main gardens. 
I finally speak up. 
"Sorry. It's just so breathtaking..."
Failing to keep the entrancing awe out of my voice, I rush to match his pace. 
The demon nods approvingly.
Lucas::
[Default]
"You have good tastes. I think you and Star will get along pretty well."
{fadeinsound: Walking on Gravel, 1}
MC::
I start walking again. 
Next time. The sightseeing will have to wait. 
I would love to sit here, relax, and eat a light lunch. 
We walk past the fountain, my sigh of disappointment leaking out.
I walk up the steps...
{fadeoutsound: waterfountainstar, 5}
{fadeoutsound: Walking on Gravel, 6}
{moveChar: Lucas, .50}
The main doors are tall, very tall, solid oak with bars reinforcing them.  
Lucas pulls on the handle.
{fadeinsound: Castle Door, 1}
{fadeoutsound: Wind Heavy, 2}
{fadeoutsound: Star Piano, 2} 
Lucas::
"Wait until you see the rest of the mansion, MC."
"It will blow your fucking mind."
