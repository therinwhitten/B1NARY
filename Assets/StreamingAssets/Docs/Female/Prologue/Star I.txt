MC::
With a desperation, I feel like I shove all that is me back into my head. 
{additive: on}
Eyesight blurring, tears welling up, 
I lay on my back. 
{additive: off}
Awareness of my body returns as the panic of my brain splitting subsides.
I feel pain with no source, and spasms harrassing my muscles. 
Don't move. Not yet. 
The light breeze buffets me, warm and gentle. 
I crack my eyes open carefully, and pain jabs me in the pupils.
"Why?"
My voice sounds hoarse, and a bit whiny. 
I place my forearm over my eyes and focus on my breathing. 
I notice moonlight. 
Bright moonlight. 
Moonlight?
I peer beyond the bottom of my forearm at the pale light spilling onto my body, and the surrounding vegetation.
I feel moisture soaking my back. 
Dew?
The rustle of grass as I move focuses my mind even more. 
I move my arm away from my eyes.....
{additive:on}
And behold an immense moon in the sky:
I can clearly see the surface easily. 
The details pop out at me. 
It is sooo close, I can almost touch it.
{additive:off} 
"Beautiful......."
Unbridling awe fills my voice.
Where.....am.........I?
I tense my stomache, and pull myself up, to the protest of my body. 
I am sitting in a field, tall grass surrounding me. 
I can't speak. 
I did not expect this?!
This is NOT the Test Server. 
{additive: on}
The test server was going to be a sterile environment. 
Shirobi even told me that it may look like a white room. 
{additive: off}
Perspective rules the day. The brain sees what it wants to see in the digital world. 
It translates what is deemed comfortable. 
Nothing about this scene is familiar. 
It feels alien. My mind did not make this up. I am sure of it. 
Getting up is a chore, but I manage.
I can't get anything done lying down. 
Besides....
My butt is wet......
With the tall grass no longer impeding my view, I see a ton of pine trees, swaying lightly in the wind.
And a dark manor off in the distance. 
Doubletake...
Manor?
I blink....twice, in fact. Just in case my 'eyes' decide to play tricks on me. 
There, in the distance, sits a very large complex. 
An ancient Romanian architectural style: a large, squared off building, with jutting towers surrounding it. 
The Count's Mansion. 
"I vant to suck your bloood.....mwhah."
I laugh despite myself. 
Masked Punk::
"Kinky....."

MC::
Suddenly, two feet in front of me, stands a masked man. 
He just....appears there. 
Compressed air smacks me in the face. 
The body looks rigid, like an iron bar, ready to spring.
I take one step back.
The mask, green light glowing behind it, <i>shimmers</i> as fog seeps out from beneath the black hoodie.
His face looks like his mask.....
"I probably taste like Flepsi??"
{additive: on}
"Anyway.........
Who the FUCK are you?"
{additive:off}
{choice: I do what I can only do....}
 {
    Kick him in the NUTS!
    [
       "Don't hurt me!"
       {changeScript: Female/Prologue/Star I A}
    ]
    Scream some more!
    [
      "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! GET AWAY!!!!!" 
    ]
 }
He screams back at me.... Mockingly...
Masked Punk::
"AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! Get away you scary demon!"
MC::
"Why are you screaming??!! You can't do that! I am screaming!"
"It's not fair!"
Masked Punk::
"I thought it was a greeting from your domain!!!"
"What is your NAME WOMAN!!!!???"
"Here I will go first!"
"Name is.... SZYCROTIC!"
MC::
He punctuates each letter empathetically.
{changeName: Masked Punk, Szycrotic}
"It's MC! Now stop screaming at me!"
Szycrotic::
"You stop first!"
MC::
We both stop, huffing and puffing.  (Star hears them)
Squaring off
