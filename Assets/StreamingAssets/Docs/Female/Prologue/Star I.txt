MC::
With a desperation, I shove all that is me back into my head. 
{additive: on}
Eyesight blurring, tears welling up, 
I lay on my back. 
{additive: off}
Long, deep breaths.
Awareness of my body returns as the panic of my brain splitting subsides.
I feel pain with no source, spasms harrassing my muscles. 
Don't move. Not yet. 
The light breeze buffets me, warm and gentle. 
I crack my eyes open carefully, pain jabs me in the pupils.
"Why?"
My voice sounds hoarse, and a bit whiny. 
I place my forearm over my eyes and focus on my breathing. 
I notice moonlight. 
Bright moonlight. 
Moonlight?
I peer beyond the bottom of my forearm at the pale light spilling onto my body, and the surrounding vegetation.
I feel moisture soaking my back. 
Dew?
The rustle of grass as I move focuses my mind even more. 
I move my arm away from my eyes...
{additive:on}
Behold, an <i>immense</i> moon in the sky.
I can clearly see the surface easily. 
The details pop out at me. 
It is sooo close, I can almost touch it.
{additive:off} 
"Beautiful..."
Unbridling awe fills my voice.
Where... am... I?
I tense my stomach, pulling myself up, to the doggedly protest of my body. 
I am sitting in a field, tall grass surrounding me. 
Frankly speechless...
I did not expect this?!
This is <i>not</i> the test server. 
{additive: on}
The test server was going to be a sterile environment. 
Shirobi even told me that it may look like a white room. 
{additive: off}
In the digital world things are more pronounced, according to theory.
Perspective rules the day. 
The brain sees what it wants to see in the digital world. 
It translates what it deems comfortable. 
Nothing about this scene is familiar. 
It feels alien. My mind did not make this up. I am sure of it. 
Getting up is a chore, but I manage.
I can't get anything done lying down. 
Besides...
My butt is wet.
With the tall grass no longer impeding my view, I notice a veritable forest of pine trees, swaying lightly in the wind.
Behind that forest, sits an impending and dark mansion...
Doubletake...
Manor?
I blink... twice, in fact. Just in case my "eyes" decide to play tricks on me. 
There, in the distance, sits a very large complex. 
An ancient Romanian architectural style: a large, squared off building, with jutting towers surrounding it. 
The Count's Mansion. 
"I vant to suck your bloood... mwhah."
I laugh despite myself. 
Masked Punk::
"Kinky..."
{fadeinsound: Szy Dark, 2}
{fadeoutsound: Star Piano, 2}
{fadeinsound: Flashstep, .3}
{moveChar: Masked Punk, .50}
MC::
Suddenly, two feet in front of me, stands a masked man. 
He just... appears there. 
Compressed air smacks me in the face. 
The body looks rigid, like an iron bar, ready to spring.
Despite myself, I take one step back.
The mask, green light glowing behind it, <i>shimmers</i> as fog seeps out from beneath the black hoodie.
His mask <i>is</i> his face...
Masked Punk::
"I probably taste like Flepsi??"
MC::
I am speechless. Who is this?!
Masked Punk::
{additive: on}
"Anyway...
Who the <i>fuck</i> are you?"
MC::
{additive:off}
{choice:}
 {
    Assert your dominance! Kick him in the nuts!
    [
       "EEEEEEKKKKK!!!!"
       MC::
       I panic, naturally.
       I send a solid kick right to his nether region. 
       {fadeinsound: body punch hard, .2}
       He catches the foot barely... I feel his hand, solid as steel.
       He whistles...
       Masked Punk::
       {additive:on}
       "Holy <i>shit</i> woman! 
       That was one hell of kick!"
       {additive:off}
       MC::
       All my jujistu training did not pay off, not against a demon.
       And now... he has my foot. 
       He drops my leg, a big grin creeping onto that mask.
       Masked Punk::
       "I can't play right now. I have to work."
       "Although... that kick is making me think twice."
       MC::
       "What is that supposed to mean?!"
       {changeScript: Female/Prologue/Star I, 128}
    ]
    Fuck that! Scream!!
    [
      "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! GET AWAY!!!!!" 
    ]
 }
He screams back at me... Mockingly...
Masked Punk::
"AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! Get away you scary demon!"
"Oh my god! You are so <i>scary</i>!"
MC::
{additive:on}
"Why are you screaming??!! 
You can't do that! 
I am screaming!"
{additive:off}
"It's not fair!"
Masked Punk::
"I thought that was a greeting from your domain!!!"
"What in the hell do you want me to do?!"
"What is your <i>name</i>, woman?"
MC::
He points to his chest, like explaining to a child, slow and deliberate.
Szycrotic::
"My name is... Szycrotic!"
MC::
{changeName: Masked Punk, Szycrotic}
"It's MC! Now stop screaming at me!"
Szycrotic::
"No! You started this, you stop first!"
MC::
We both stop, huffing and puffing.  
I just got here... I am already having to deal with something I am not ready for.
I can't hurt this man. He is too strong. Too fast. 
There is no way!
Look at him!
{additive: on}
Squaring off, 
legs spread wide,
we face each other.
{additive:off}
Only several feet separate us. I feel like he can instantly catch me if he really wants to.
He is standing there in the same stance as me for fun. 
Like it is some game I decided to play!
We stare at each other for a few moments.
It feels way longer than that.
And then...
The fear, crazily enough, dissolves slowly.
The whole situation has me... just confused.
{additive:on}
I expected many things.
Things that <i>might</i> happen. 
Server glitches, feelings of disorientation,
even the symptoms of brain pattern degredation.
{additive: off}
I did not plan on facing down a demon with a mask for a face.  
He relaxes his stance, a huge grin smearing his "face."
{fadeoutsound: Szy Dark, 4}
{fadeinsound: Star Piano, 4}
He suddenly starts laughing heartily.
I watch him, blinking several times, unsure what to say, or do.
Szycrotic::
{additive:on}
"Oh my God, MC.
Yo, that was awesome!"
{additive:off}
"Your fucking face was priceless!"
MC::
His bellowing laugh pushes a bit more green steam out from behind his mask.
It is pretty unnerving.
Syzcrotic::
"Thank you for that, MC. If I had tearducts, I would be crying."
MC::
I feel my cheeks puff out in a pout.
"Szycrotic?"
Szycrotic::
"Yes?"
MC::
"You don't go about scaring women walking around at night!"
The name Szycrotic, I <i>do</i> know.
Like an avalanche, the recognition of the name comes crashing into my conscious thoughts.
I <i>know</i> who he is. I can't believe it though. 
I am not on the server as planned at all. 
Now... I have no clue where I am actually at.
"Domain..."
I try the word carefully.
Szycrotic appears to be watching me mull over things. He tilts his head to the left a bit.
Szycrotic::
"Wait... you know who I am, don't you?"
MC::
He puffs his chest up a bit.
Syzcrotic::
"Finally! Someone recogizes me!"
"Hell yeah, les gooooo!"
MC::
He pauses and locks eyes with me.
Syzcrotic::
"To the manor, I mean. Les go to the manor."
"You are technically an intruder, but you don't seem dangerous."
MC::
"I am certainly not dangerous. Far from it."
He motions to the manor, down the path not far off. 
Szycrotic::
"Come. I will take you to Star, and we will figure this all out."
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .25}
{fadeinsound: walkingongravel, 1}
MC::
He starts off at a leisurely pace, enough for a short woman to follow.
<i>Sigh</i>
I step in behind him. 
"Asterella Star?"
Szycrotic::
"Yes, you apparently know her too. That makes things alot easier."
{additive:on}
"She normally doesn't see people late at night, 
but she specifically 
<i>requested</i> 
me to come get you."
{additive:off}
MC::
He looks back to ensure I am following, with a glint of green-lit smoke leaking out.
He turns his head back around.
Szycrotic::
"You don't seem to have any real power..."
"Then again, you could just be hiding it."
MC::
He shrugs nonchalantly.
Szycrotic::
{additive:on}
"Whelp, not my problem. 
Long as you don't harm this domain, 
or Star, 
I really don't give a shit what you do."
{additive:off}
{additive:on}
"Welcome to the 69th Circle of Hell, MC.
I hope you enjoy your stay."
{additive:off}
MC::
The signature greeting sends shivers down my spine.
This is <i>real</i>!
Not a stream online, but-in-the-flesh real!
And Szycrotic is taking me to <i>the</i> Asterella Star!
Oh no! 
What do I do?!
A sudden wave of nervousness envelops me.
I have always admired her from afar.
Yes, I do stream, but I barely chat with people on a personal level. 
She is <i>huge</i> now. She has been doing this for 20 years or so.
I come back to myself, studying Szy's back. 
This doesn't feel like a place you would stream from. 
As we near the outer wall of the huge complex: the smells, the wind, all of it.
It gives me a shock. This feels real. All too real. 
And Szy, is he really roleplaying? Or is he...
Has he always been a demon? Or are they just into their roles in this virtual world?
We get to an entrance, the old gate opening without any external forces acting on it. 
Syzcrotic::
"Hey MC, you can look as we go. Plenty of time for that later."
"We need to see Star first ok?"
MC::
I nod.
Who am I to disagree? He could tie me up in an instant. 
Not that I would want him to.
I said, player, that I do <i>not</i> want to be tied up...
As we pass the ingress, my eyes are bathed in beauty.
{fadeoutsound: walkingongravel, 1}
{fadeinsound: waterfountain, 2}
{additive: on}
Lush oak and ash trees dot the landscape in a chaotic symmetry.
The wind caressing their leaves. 
The bright moonlight bathes and reflects off of the black marble benches, their place painstakingly chosen.
{additive:off}
Right in front of the manor, sits a large fountain, the water sparkling from the moonlight. 
Szycrotic::
"Yo! You coming?"
MC::
Oh... I am not walking. 
I stand frozen, taking in the sights. 
I made it four feet into the main gardens. 
I speak up.
"Sorry. It's just so exquisite..."
Failing to keep the entrancing awe out of my voice, I rush to match his pace. 
The demon nods approvingly.
Syzcrotic::
"You have good tastes. I think you and Star will get along pretty well."
{fadeinsound: walkingongravel, 1}
MC::
I start walking again. 
Next time. 
I would love to sit here and just eat a light lunch. 
I walk past the fountain, sighing in disappointment as we head to the main doors of the masion.
I walk up the steps...
{fadeoutsound: waterfountain, 5}
{fadeoutsound: walkingongravel, 6}
{moveChar: Szycrotic, .50}
The main doors are tall, standing an easy 1.5 meters in height, solid oak with bars reinforcing them. 
He pulls on the handle.
{fadeinsound: castle door, 1}
{fadeoutsound: Wind Heavy, 2}
{fadeoutsound: Star Piano, 2} 
Szycrotic::
"Wait until you see the rest of the mansion, MC."
"It will blow your mind."
