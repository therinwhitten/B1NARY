The brain sucking chair...
All the lab techs cringe when I call it that, but I don't care.
The mechanical whirring of laptops, server fans, and the hum of the EM fields surrounding the chair, resonate inside my skull.
The reporters haven't noticed me yet.
I swallow nervously.
Even around all of these people, I feel like I'm truly alone.
I take a few steps into the room.
{fadeinsound: slowfootsteps, .2}

Left...
right...

right...
{additive:off}
Someone grabs my shoulder, instantly causing me to jump.
I squeak, the sound coming out of it's own volition.
{choice: Do I face them?}
{
     I am scared! I should probably stay put.
     [
       I feel the hand grip me tight. And twirl me around.
     ]
     Face the music.
     [
       I whirl around.

{fadeinsound: Press Cameras, .2}
The lights of the cameras blind me.
I attempt to blink away the glaring brightness, raising my hand to shade my eyes.
{spawnChar: malesilo, 2, Old Reporter}
Old Reporter::
{anim: Old Reporter, kime1}
{moveChar: Old Reporter, .85}
{if: n-b,false}
{
 "There she is! MC?"
}
{if: n-b,true}
{
 "There they are! MC?"
}
"Are you ok? You don't look very chipper."
The old coot laughs, the sound straining to combat the tension in the air.
"Must be nerve wracking for billions of people to watch you make history, am I right?"
MC::
Why do they have to make the lighting so harsh in here?! 
And why did he have to point out how many are watching?! 
I think I'm going to throw up...
I control my breathing, trying to push back the nausea with sheer force of will.
"Yes, I'm ok."
I paint on my best smile. Nothing is wrong, reporter guy.
My eyes narrow for just a second.
"I'm just a bit nervous with everyone looking at me."
{additive: on}
"But so much has been done to make this happen!
I'm pumped to get to work!"
{additive:off}
I look at the camera closest to me.
"I won't let you down!" 
{additive: off}
{spawnChar: malesilo, -1, Cliff}
Cliff::
{moveChar: Cliff, .25}  
{anim: Cliff, kime2}
MC::
My eyes start to adjust. I notice Cliff, the lead project manager, behind the press, arms crossed and a look of concern on his face.
Why is no one saying anything?
Suddenly uncomfortable, I keep silent, watching everyone study me.
{additive: on}
There is a surprising amount of people whispering in this tiny room.
I feel very small, wanting to compress myself, 
but there's nowhere to go,
except the chair.
{additive: off}
In my pockets, sits the letter from my mom I received this morning, full of praise and excitement.
{additive: on}
To be a part of this project,
and to spearhead such a huge change of direction in humanity's future,
fills my parents with such pride... And worry. 
{additive: off}
My poor parents, but they'll have to accept my decision here. 
{additive: on}
The affidavit I signed yesterday was pretty clear:
possible memory loss,
loss of self,
coma,
death.
{additive: off}
The NDA is permanent. There is <i>no</i> expiration date. 
I didn't think such a thing existed. 
It's a very dangerous experiment, there was only a few candidates auditioning.
On a positive note, I could stream inside the internet to my fans.
I may be a small streamer, but I was one of the few that wouldn't go through the process of copying myself.
It just doesn't feel right to the people watching.
I don't condemn others for choosing otherwise. They have their own reasons, surely. 
And I respect that. 
When given a chance, I leapt at it.
Imagine if people can transport into the internet at will in the future because of this experiment.
Don't think too much of it, MC. You're already insanely nervous.
I look down, my hands shaking of their own volition.
{moveChar: Cliff, -1}
{moveChar: Old Reporter, 2}
{moveChar: Shirobi, .70}
{additive: on}
{anim: Shirobi, Checktime}
Scratching the back of my neck,
I scan the small crowd through the blinding lights to find Shirobi,
the lab intern.
{additive: off}
I met him at college. Just a few classes. 
After a couple of months, we became fast friends. 
He's too tall for his own good, and a little dorky. He's a good guy though.
And... He is hilariously cute when he pushes his glasses up the bridge of his nose.
He may be, to most, an annoying person. To me? He is a trustworthy friend. 
Look at him, PDA in hand, watching my expression, his face betraying his worry.
{additive: on}
I smile my best smile,
which always makes him blush a bit.
Shirobi::
{anim: Shirobi, Glasses}
MC:: 
His posture abruptly relaxes.
{additive: off}
I love to tease him, and he knows it. 
I could hear some of the press chuckling over that.
"Shibi, MC reporting as ordered!" 
My tone is mockingly serious. I even throw in a salute.
He also hates when I call him Shibi. He takes himself way too seriously sometimes. 
He nods sagely, a slight smile curving his lips.
He motions towards the DIHI. 
{anim: Shirobi, Thisway}
Shirobi::
{additive: on}
"I'm in charge of watching all your vitals.
{anim: Shirobi, Bow}
So please... take this seriously?
{additive:off}
"It's four days in. That's it."
"No trying to stay in the servers, MC. Ok?"
MC::
My eyebrows raise on their own accord. 
"I'll be good, I promise. Wouldn't want you to get worried."  
I obliquely notice the press being escorted out of the DIHI room.
{fadeinsound: LeavingFootsteps, .3}
{fadeinsound: Door, 2}
{fadeoutsound: LabAmbience, .1}
{fadeoutsound: Lab Ambience Music Light, 5}
The sound of the DIHI suddenly changes, and the feel of ionizing in the air increases.
The whole room <i>vibrates</i>.
There is no other word for it.
It feels like the chair is creating it's own realm inside this room.
I watch as the press sits down behind the observation glass, grabbing coffee and chatting. 
For a brief second, I hesitate.
Ok, <i>that</i> is bringing back my urge to bolt.
Shibi speaks up, his tone forcibly casual.
Shirobi::
"The process is pretty mundane actually." 
{additive: on}
"Your body will be inert,
breathing, 
heartbeat... 
{additive:off}
MC::
Shibi taps his temple.
Shirobi::
"However, no one will be there."
"We'll store your body immediately in stasis." 
"So, no worries MC, you will be taken care of." 
"I promise."

{spawnChar: malesilo, 2, MC}
{spawnChar: malesilo1, 2, Shirobi}
MC::
I center myself in front of the portal to the Digital Realm.
It feels so surreal.
A small part of me is panicking, screaming at me to leave the room.
It's too dangerous to stay!
The vibrations start to resonate even in my lungs, like they do in a concert when you are too close to the speakers. 
<i>Leave. Now!</i>
It's starting to affect my state of mind. I shove the fear down, and take a step. 
Tendrils of coolant mist emanates from the contraption.
Shirobi moves to the console next to the chair.
When he shuts down the pre-scanners, the path opens to the chair. The hum lowers in volume a bit. 
Shirobi::
"Ok. It begins here."
"Just have a seat."
"I will see you on the other side, ok?"
MC:: 
Shirobi, looking a little nervous himself, motions to the seat.
I swallow down my fear, realizing it's already too late to go back.
{additive: on}
I take another step, and the resonation increases,
humming,
pulsating,
my body's rhythm attempting to match.
{additive: off}
The light matches the pulses, as if alive, eating the darkness of the rest of the room.
Even the floor is vibrating.
I take another step, pivot, and sit down. 
The cushion does little to comfort me, the metal chair digging into my rear end.
It's like sitting in the eye of a hurricane. It is eerily calm.
"I am ready, Shibi. Don't hit the wrong button, ok?"
{additive: on}
I feel fingers on my forehead,
cool to the touch,
gently push my head back against the throbbing headrest.
The calming touch allows me to breathe. 
{additive: off}
I pivot my head slightly, my eyes meet Shirobi's. He smiles briefly one more time. 
Shirobi::
"Just close your eyes... BAAAAKA."
MC::
"Baka?"
I laugh forcibly.
"You really need to get out more, Shirobi." 
I comply, closing my eyes.
"You know, I have some friends that would be interested in a weeb..." 
I manage wryly.
The fear keeps me talking more than I normally would have. Anything to release some tension at this point.
Shirobi lightly flicks my forehead.
{fadeinsound: fingerflick, .01}
"Hey!"
Shirobi::
"Hush you. Try to contain yourself ok? And will you stop trying to match me already?"
MC::
{fadeinsound: touchscreentaps, .01}
I could hear him fiddle with switches and tap the screen of his pad.
It's odd how loud it is over the sound the chair.
I honestly don't know what to expect, and that unknown scares me more as the seconds move forward.
{fadeinsound: DIHI Power Up, .5}
I can hear the build of power. The chair's resonation syncs and becomes all one sound, screeching inside my skull.
Putting on a brave face no longer suits me. I clench the chair's arm rests. I hold back a scream. 
I don't want to die. 
The top of my head begins to tingle. 
Oh my god, I think I'm...

{fadeoutsound: DIHI Low Power, .1}

{fadeoutsound: Laptop-Lab,.1}
Then, with an almost gut-wrenching lurch, everything escapes from the top of my head...
