Shirobi:: 
"MC! She has been an intern with the company for over a year now....."
MC::
The brain sucking chair....
The lab techs cringe when I say that, but I don't care.
Mechanical whirring of laptops, server fans, and the hum of the EM fields surrounding the chair resonates inside my skull.
The reporters haven't noticed me yet.
I swallow nervously.
Even though I am around all of these people, I feel like I am truly alone.
I take a few steps into the room hesitantly.

Left...

{additive:off}
Someone grabs my shoulder, instantly causing me to jump.
I squeak, the sound coming out of it's own volition.
{choice: Do I face them?}
{
     I am scared! Stay put.
     [
         I feel the hand grip me tight. And twirl me around.
     ]
     Face the music.
     [
         I whirl,
     ]    
}
{fadeoutsound: Heartbeat, 1}
{changeBG: DIHI Room Animated}
And turn to face the lights and cameras behind me.
{fadeinsound: Press Cameras, .2}
I attempt to blink away the glaring brightness, raising my hand to shade my eyes.
{spawnChar: malesilo, 2, John}
{moveChar: John, .85}
John::
"MC! Are you ok? You don't look very chipper."
John laughs, the sound straining to combat the tension in the air.
"Must be nerve wracking for billions of people to watch you make history, am I right?"
MC::
Why do they have to make the lighting so harsh in here?! 
And why did he have to point out how many are watching?! 
I control my breathing.
"Yes, I am ok."
I paint on my best smile. Nothing is wrong, reporter guy.
"The unknown of a new dimension? Count me in!"
"I am just a bit nervous with everyone looking at me."
{additive: on}
"So much has been done to make this happen.
I am excited to get to work!"
{additive:off}
"I won't let you down!" 
{additive: off}
{spawnChar: malesilo, -1, Cliff}
{moveChar: Cliff, .25}  
Eyes start to adjust, and I notice Cliff, the lead project manager, behind the press, arms crossed and a look of concern on his features.
Why is no one saying anything??!!
Suddenly uncomfortable, I keep silent, watching everyone study me.
{additive: on}
There is a surprising amount of people whispering in this tiny room!
I feel very small, wanting to compress myself, but there is nowhere to go,
except the chair.
{additive: off}
In my pocket, sits the letter from mom I received this morning, full of praise and excitement.
{additive: on}
To be a part of this project,
and to spearhead such an huge change of direction in humanity's future,
fills my parents with such pride, and worry. 
{additive: off}
{additive: on}
The affidavit I signed yesterday was pretty clear:
possible memory loss,
loss of self,
coma,
death.
{additive: off}
The NDA is permanent.
It it a very dangerous experiment, and very few would volunteer.
On a positive note, I could stream in the internet to my fans.
I may be a small streamer, but I was one of the few that wouldn't go through the process of copying myself.
It just doesn't feel right to the people watching.
So when given a chance, I leapt at it.
Imagine if people can transport into the internet at will in the future because of this experiment?
{moveChar: Cliff, -1}
{moveChar: John, 2}
{spawnChar: malesilo, 2, Shirobi}
{moveChar: Shirobi, .75}
{additive: on}
Scratching the back of my neck,
I scan the small crowd through the blinding lights to find Shirobi,
the Lab Intern.
{additive: off}
I know him from a few of my classes.
He is too tall for his own good, and a little dorky, but a good guy.
And..... he is hilariously cute when he pushes his glasses up the bridge of his nose.
He may be, to most, a slightly annoying person, but to me, he is a trustworthy friend. 
I spy him, PDA in hand, watching my expression, his face betraying his worry.
{additive: on}
I smile my best smile,
which always makes him blush a bit (it's really funny and he knows I like to tease him),
and his posture abruptly relaxes.
{additive: off}
I could hear some of the press chuckling over that.
"Ready when you are Shibi." , I say, mockingly serious, saluting him.
He also hates when I call him that. He takes himself way too seriously sometimes. 
Shirobi::
He nods sagely, a slight smile curving his lips.
He motions towards the DIHI. 
{additive: on}
"I am in charge of watching all your vitals.
Four days of testing and out ok?
No trying to stay in the servers, MC......"
{additive: off}
MC::
My eyebrows raise of their own accord. 
"I will be good, I promise. Wouldn't want you to get worried."  
I obliquely notice the press being escorted out of the DIHI room.
{fadeinsound: LeavingFootsteps, .3}
{fadeinsound: Door, .1}
{fadeoutsound: LabAmbience, .1}
{fadeoutsound: Lab Ambience Music Light, 2}
The sound of the DIHI suddenly changes, and the feel of ionizing in the air increases.<.i>
{fadeinsound: DIHI Up Close, 1}
The whole room VIBRATES.
There is no other word for it.
It feels like the chair is creating it's own realm inside this room.
I watch as the press sits down behind the observation glass, grabbing coffee and chatting. 
For a brief second, I hesitate.
Ok, THAT is a little unnerving.
Shirobi::
"The process is pretty mundane actually." 
{additive: on}
"Your body will be inert,
breathing, 
heartbeat, 
but no one there. 
We will store it immediately in stasis. 
Don't worry, MC, you will be well taken care of. 
I promise."
{additive:off}

{fadeinsound: slowfootsteps, 1}
MC::
I center myself in front of the Portal to the Digital Realm.
It feels so surreal, so much so that I feel detachment from the situation.
A small part of me is paniking, screaming at me to leave the room.
It's too dangerous to stay!
The vibrations start to resonate even in my lungs, like they do in a concert when you are too close to the speakers. 
LEAVE. NOW.
It is starting to affect my state of mind. I shove the fear down, and take a step. 
Tendrils of coolant mists emanuate from the contraption.
Shirobi::
Shirobi moves to the console next to the chair.
Shutting the scanners down opens the path to the chair. The hum lowers in volume a bit. 
"Ok here we go MC."
"Have fun."
"I will see you on the other side ok?"
Shirobi, looking a little nervous himself, motions to the seat.
MC:: 
I swallow down my fear, realizing it is already too late to go back.
{additive: on}
I take another step, and the resonation increases,
humming,
pulsating,
my body's rhythm attempting to match.
{additive: off}
The light pulses, as if alive, eating the darkness of the rest of the room.
Even the floor is vibrating.
I take another step, pivot and sit down. 
It resembles a ride in the center of a hurricane.
Nausea starts to rise in my stomach.
"I am ready, Shibi! Please take care of me!"
{additive: on}
I feel fingers on my forehead,
cool to the touch,
gently push my head back against the throbbing headrest.
The calming touch allows me to breathe. 
{additive: off}
My eyes meet Shirobi's. He smiles briefly one more time. 
{fadeinsound: DIHI Power Up, 1}
Shirobi::
"Close your eyes......baka."
MC::
I comply. 
"Don't try and sneak a kiss...." 
I manage wryly.
It is more fear forcing me to speak. To ease the tension.
Shirobi lightly flicks my forehead.
Shirobi::
"Hush you. Try and contain yourself ok? I don't want to clean up nosebleeds afterwards."
MC::
I could hear him fiddle with switches and tap the screen of his Pad.
Odd how loud it is, but I can hear that?
I honestly don't know what to expect, and that unknown scares me more as the seconds move forward.
