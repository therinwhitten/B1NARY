MC::
Large swaths of livid orchid contrasts with dark oak throughout most of the manor.
Dozens of rooms, a whole staff, at least 40 people I count so far work here.
{additive:on} 
Some of those people didn't look human.  
Some wear horns, 
and others had long sweeping tails. 
{additive:off}
So many rooms, and I could see at least two waiting rooms, a ball room, and a library. 
Szycrotic was humming some unidentifiable tune, I could not recognize. 
Everytime I tried to ask him what it is, he would hush me and motion forward. 
This room is no different. 
Everything is set up in a simple, yet elegant decor. 
Dark Purples and ancient oak.
Oh....my GOD....
There she is!
{moveChar: Asterella, .75}
{additive:on}
Reading a large book, 
Asterella Star, 
Lord of the 69th Circle of Hell,
leaning back in comfort on the crushed velvet sofa.
{additive:off}
She looks up as we come in, shifting a bit, exposing pale, bare skin underneath a veneer, lavender shift.
I can't mistake her: the long, delicate horns, the floating crown of blue diamonds. 
She is shorter than I thought she would be. Her curves though......
{fadeinsound: Heart Thump, .1}
She opens her mouth, a tone of impatience, and light annoyance, coloring her speech.
Asterella::
"Szy, it's about time you brought our 'guest'."
She closes the book with a finality.
Szycrotic::
"Look woman, she wanted to see the garden. Don't blame me!"
MC::
Szycrotic shoots a sidelong glance at me. 
He seems to get an idea....
Szycrotic::
{additive:on}
"How can you deny that face? 
Look at her! 
She was almost floating on clouds when she was in the garden!"
{additive:off}
MC::
Asterella makes eye contact with me. I feel the red rushing to my cheeks. 
Asterella::
"She <i>is</i> cute...."
"So cute, I could just EAT her up!"
MC::
Panic rises. 
Star laughs, placing the book on the coffee table.
Asterella::
"I don't eat humans, dear. So, calm yourself."
MC::
Her voice becomes a mockingly serious. 
Asterella::
"Szy, I can't forgive lateness."
"I think a night in the dungeon should rectify making me wait longer than necessary."
MC::
What?
{additive:on}
"Wait! You can't! 
He has been kind to me!"
{additive:off}
What am I doing?
{choice: Take the blame?}

        It's my fault! (H-Scene)

            "Please...it was my fault. I am to blame."
            The admission feels weird, this man scared the shit out of me, at first anyway.
            He is also a demon. 
            "It was my fault we are late Lord Star!"
            "If punishing me eases his, I will take it!"
            Asterella smiles, and it only touches her lips.
            Asterella::
            "I could do that if you were willing, after all."
            "But he loves his punishment."
            "Are you sure?"
            MC::

        Say nothing more.

            {setbool: starbed, false}
            I can't. 
            He scared the shit out of me. 
            I am technically a prisoner right now. 
            A small part of me knows he is a good "demon".
            Well.....if there is such a thing.

            It shouldn't be bad for him right? 
            Maybe I am going too far here...
            I look at Sycrotic. 
            Asterella::
            "Lost your courage?"
            MC::
        ]
    }
}
Oh my god I am choking.
I need to calm down.
Asterella raises her eyebrows, standing up. 
Asterella::
"She seems pretty protective of you. Do I need to increase the punishment?"
MC::
I stand aghast. I don't want to add more to his pain...
Szycrotic::
"Oh yeah dommy mommy, give me the punishment I deserve."
MC::
He laughs heartily, walks up, and kisses Star on the forehead. 
With a wave as he opens the door, he replies.
Szycrotic::
"You two have fun!"
{fadeinsound: Door, 1}
{moveChar: Szycrotic, -1}
{moveChar: Asterella, .50}
MC::
We are alone. Star and I.
As if on cue, she strides confidently to me.
Merely feet away, she studies me. 
She is a bit shorter than me, but her presence of authority is palpable.
Despite myself, I feel myself wanting to surrender to her. 
She is every inch a Lord. 
Asterella::
"So, do you have a name?"
MC::
She lets the question hang there open. 
Oh!
"Name is MC, Lord Star."
I stammer it. 
I moan internally.
I am wrecking the first impression. 
Her face is unreadable. Her best poker face. 
This close, I can see that her underwear underneath are pretty revealing.
Almost transparent. 
I can smell lavendar and......brimstone?
She is that close. 
She nods and smiles a genuine smile. 
Asterella::
"That is a very nice name, MC."
{additive: on}
"Before we talk business, 
I would like to relax a bit.
Do you fancy some wine, Perhaps?"
{additive:off}
MC::
Anything to break this trance. 
"Yes, please."
"That would be very nice. I am pretty thirsty, actually."
She motions to the couch gracefully.
Asterella::
"Please, be seated. I will bring the wine."
MC::
She moves to a table against the wall, cueing me to move.
I make my way to the soft, velvet couch. 
The whole room screams humble royalty, as if she has no need for gaudy reminders of who she is.
She knows.
Asterella::
"You know, as an intruder, I imagine you wouldn't expect this kind of hospitality."
"I don't see you as an intruder exactly."
MC::
I sit down on one side, giving her plenty of room. The book she was reading...
I can't read the title. 
{additive: on}
I lean forward more to try and see if I recognize the language, 
but it looks like gibberish to me.
Some old, archaic language, I think.
But I am no expert.
{additive:off}
Does...she know something?
"If you do not consider me an intruder, then who am I to you?"
I follow that up quickly.....
Maybe a bit too desperate.
"I can assure you, it was not intentional for me to be here."
{fadeinsond: woodwine1, .1}
Asterella::
"I surmised as much. But that doesn't clear you."
{fadeinsound: woodwine2, .1}
{fadeinsound: glasspouring, 1}
"You still haven't told me where you came from."
"And you don't seem to be a Synthgen. It doesn't feel right to me."
{fadeinsound: glasspouring, 1}
MC::
She grabs the glasses and glides gracefully to the couch, proffering one to me.
I take it gratefully.

            "I really can't tell you that without knowing more about you, and exactly how I got here."

            There. The truth, yet holding back the infomation I DARE not disclose. 
            I hope it was good enough....
            She traces the edge of her wineglass thoughtfully.
            Asterella::
            "Fair enough. I can accept that for now."
            "Questions will come later though, I promise."

        Make up something.
        [
          "I was just walking through the forest and found your manor. I didn't mean to encroach on your land."
          Partial truth, but even I don't think I would believe it.
          And neither will she.
          Star frowns. 
          Asterella::
          {additive: on}
          "There are very few things I will not tolerate.
          One of those things is lying.
          This is my only warning."

          "I'm sorry. 
          You are right. 
          I probably know less than you right now about my current situation."
          {additive: off}
          "I don't feel comfortable talking to you about this yet."
          I quickly follow that up.
          "I don't mean harm to your domain, nor your people. That much is certain."
          She studies me, did I detect a bit of suspicion in that look?
          Asterella::
          "I will accept that for now. I can understand that position."
          MC::
        ]
    }
{additive:on}
She seats herself close to me. 
Only a foot or two separates us.
{additive:off}
I stare at the glass, the dark, pungent liquid sparkling in the light of the crackling fire.
Asterella::
"To future relationships."
MC::
She brings her glass towards mine, and we toast.
{fadeinsound: winetoast, .1} 
MC::
"Future relationships."
We take the first sip in silence. The taste is very smokey, and clean. 
I resist the urge to drink it too fast. 
"So why all the ceremony for just me?"
A small smile touches her lips.
Asterella::
{additive:on}
"Straight to the point. 
I like that."
{additive:off}
MC::
The voice is almost sultry as she looks up from her glass.
She takes another sip and puts the glass down on the table carefully. 
{fadeinsound: wineglassdown, 1}
A pause.
Asterella::
"Two things..." 
MC::
She holds up one finger. 
Asterella::
"Number one."
"You have come to my realm without my permission."
{additive:on}
"That is not so easily done here. 
So...either you have an impressive level of power....
or you are not a part of the system."
{additive:off}
MC::
She looks at me, musing to herself.
Asterella::
{additive:on}
"I want to assume it's the latter. But.....obviously, 
I can't do that without...
studying you."
{additive:off}
MC::
She tries to read my eyes, looking for something?
A bit of frustration leaks out in her sigh.
Astrella::
{additive:on}
"You see, MC, 
you have piqued my interest.
I assure you, that is a good thing."
{additive:off}
MC::
She pointedly makes direct eye contact.
"Way better than the alternative."
MC::
I audibly gulp a bit. She is scary and sensual at the same time.
"And the second thing?"
Star's eyes turn hungry.
Asterella::
"Second?"
MC::
She leans forward and places a hand on my thigh.
Asterella::
"You see, MC, you are exactly my type."
"We demons have a way of easing each other's minds."
MC::
She watches her hand lazily make circles on my thigh. 
Asterella::
"Intimate interactions help form bonds, that would be nigh to impossible in our realm."
MC::
I can't believe what I am hearing....
Is she asking for....
"Me?"
It was all I can say.
I take a deep pull of the wine, covering my blushing face behind the action.
Asterella Star is asking me to "spend the night" with her. 
She looks up at me, with the question in her eyes.
