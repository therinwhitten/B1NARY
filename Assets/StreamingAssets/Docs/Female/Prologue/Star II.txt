MC::
Large swaths of livid orchid contrasts with dark oak throughout most of the manor.
Dozens of rooms, a whole staff, at least 40 people I count so far work here.
{additive:on} 
Some of those people didn't look human.  
Some wear horns, 
and others had long sweeping tails. 
{additive:off}
So many rooms, and I could see at least two waiting rooms, a ball room, and a library. 
Szycrotic was humming some unidentifiable tune, I could not recognize. 
Everytime I tried to ask him what it is, he would hush me and motion forward. 
This room is no different. 
Everything is set up in a simple, yet elegant decor. 
Dark Purples and ancient oak.
Oh....my GOD....
There she is!
{moveChar: Asterella, .75}
{additive:on}
Reading a large book, 
Asterella Star, 
Lord of the 69th Circle of Hell,
leaning back in comfort on the crushed velvet sofa.
{additive:off}
She looks up as we come in, shifting a bit, exposing pale, bare skin underneath a veneer, lavender shift.
I can't mistake her: the long, delicate horns, the floating crown of blue diamonds. 
She is shorter than I thought she would be. Her curves though......
{fadeinsound: Heart Thump, .1}
She opens her mouth, a tone of impatience, and light annoyance coloring her speech.
Asterella::
"Szy, it's about time you brought our 'guest'."
She closes the book with a finality.
Szycrotic::
"Look woman, she wanted to see the garden. Don't blame me!"
MC::
Szycrotic shoots a sidelong glance at me. 
He seems to get an idea....
Szycrotic::
{additive:on}
"How can you deny that face? 
Look at her! 
She was almost floating on clouds when she was in the garden!"
{additive:off}
MC::
Asterella makes eye contact with me. I feel the red rushing to my cheeks. 
Asterella::
"She <i>is</i> cute! I could just EAT her up!"
MC::
Panic rises. 
Star laughs, placing the book on the coffee table.
Asterella::
"I don't eat humans, dear. So, calm yourself."
MC::
Her voice becomes a mockingly serious. 
Asterella::
"Szy, I can't forgive lateness."
"I think a night in the dungeon should rectify making me wait longer than necessary."
MC::
What?
{additive:on}
"Wait! You can't! 
He has been kind to me!"
{additive:off}
What am I doing?
{choice: Take the blame?}
{
        It's my fault!
        [
            {setbool: starbed, true}
            MC::
            "Please...it was my fault. I am to blame."
            The admission feels weird, this man scared the shit out of me, at first anyway.
            He is also a demon. 
            "It was my fault we are late Lord Star!"
            "If punishing me eases his, I will take it!"
            Asterella smiles, and it only touches her mouth.
            Asterella::
            "I could do that if you were willing, after all."
            "But he loves his punishment."
        ]
        Say nothing more. 
        [
            {setbool: starbed, false}
            I can't. 
            He scared the shit out of me. 
            I am technically a prisoner right now. 
            A small part of me knows he is a good "demon".
            Well.....if there is such a thing.
        ]
    }
{if: starbed, true}
{
    {choice: Will you take Star's offer?}
    {
        Yes, I am ready for whatever she has planned.
        [
            Ok let's go to Papa Jonathan's!
        ]
        Nevermind, I can't do this!
        [
            Alright shall we go to 巴巴布伊 then?
        ]
    }
}
Oh my god I am choking.
I need to calm down.
Asterella raises her eyebrows, standing up. 
Asterella::
"Oh? Do I need to increase the punishment?"
MC::
I stand aghast. I don't want to add more to his pain...
Szycrotic::
"Oh yeah dommy mommy, give me the punishment I deserve."
MC::
He laughs heartily, walks up, and kisses Star on the forehead. 
With a wave as he opens the door, he replies.
Szycrotic::
"You two have fun!"
