Large swaths of regal orchid contrasts with dark oak throughout most of the manor.
Judging from the dozens of rooms I have walked through, there are at least 40 people on staff here. Maybe more. 
{additive:on} 
Some of those people were not human.
They looked more like Demi humans, like from video games or from anime that Shirobi would watch.
There were even species I couldn't recognize. 
Were they other V-Tubers? Or something different altogether?
{additive:off}
So many rooms. I could see at least two waiting rooms, a ball room, and a library. 
Szycrotic was humming some unidentifiable tune I could not recognize. 
Every time I tried to ask him what it was, he would hush me and motion forward. 
This room matches the rest of the manor.
Set up in a simple yet elegant decor. 
Dark purple and ancient oak.
Oh!
There she is!

Reading a large book, 
Asterella Star, 
Lord of the 69th Circle of Hell,
leaning back in comfort on the crushed velvet sofa.

She looks up as we come in, shifting a bit and exposing pale, bare skin underneath a veneer, lavender shift.
I can't mistake her. The long, delicate horns. The floating crown of blue diamonds. 
She is shorter than I thought she would be. Her curves though.
Ara Ara...
{fadeinsound: Heart Thump, .1}
She opens her mouth, an impression of impatience and light annoyance coloring her speech.
Asterella::

"If you do not consider me an intruder, then who am I to you?"
