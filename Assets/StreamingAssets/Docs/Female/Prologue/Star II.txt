MC::
Large swaths of livid orchid contrasts with dark oak throughout most of the manor.
Dozens of rooms, a whole staff, at least 40 people I count so far work here.
{additive:on} 
Some of those people didn't look human.  
Some wear horns, 
and others had long sweeping tails. 
{additive:off}
So many rooms, and I could see at least two waiting rooms, a ball room, and a library. 
Szycrotic was humming some unidentifiable tune, I could not recognize. 
Everytime I tried to ask him what it is, he would hush me and motion forward. 
This room is no different. 
Everything is set up in a simple, yet elegant decor. 
Dark Purples and ancient oak.
Oh....my GOD....
There she is!
{moveChar: Asterella, .75}
{additive:on}
Reading a large book, 
Asterella Star, 
Lord of the 69th Circle of Hell,
leaning back in comfort on the crushed velvet sofa.
{additive:off}
She looks up as we come in, shifting a bit, exposing pale, bare skin underneath a veneer, lavender shift.
I can't mistake her: the long, delicate horns, the floating crown of blue diamonds. 
She is shorter than I thought she would be. Her curves though......
{fadeinsound: Heart Thump, .1}
She opens her mouth, a tone of impatience, and light annoyance, coloring her speech.
Asterella::
"Szy, it's about time you brought our 'guest'."
She closes the book with a finality.
Szycrotic::
"Look woman, she wanted to see the garden. Don't blame me!"
MC::
Szycrotic shoots a sidelong glance at me. 
He seems to get an idea....
Szycrotic::
{additive:on}
"How can you deny that face? 
Look at her! 
She was almost floating on clouds when she was in the garden!"
{additive:off}
MC::
Asterella makes eye contact with me. I feel the red rushing to my cheeks. 
Asterella::
"She <i>is</i> cute...."
"So cute, I could just EAT her up!"
MC::
Panic rises. 
Star laughs, placing the book on the coffee table.
Asterella::
"I don't eat humans, dear. So, calm yourself."
MC::
Her voice becomes a mockingly serious. 
Asterella::
"Szy, I can't forgive lateness."
"I think a night in the dungeon should rectify making me wait longer than necessary."
MC::
What?
{additive:on}
"Wait! You can't! 
He has been kind to me!"

            "It was my fault we are late Lord Star!"
            "If punishing me eases his, I will take it!"
            Asterella smiles, and it only touches her lips.
            Asterella::
            "I could do that if you were willing, after all."
            "But he loves his punishment."

           I feel a surge of regret. 
           I WILL stand my ground!
           I can hear the shuffling of bare feet on the floor, coming towards me.
           Szycrotic::

           I see nothing, and Star's voice is incredibly close.
           I can hear the shifting of silk against skin, and the fire crackle. 
           "Yes."
           I prepare to flinch....
           {fadeinsound: body punch hard, 1}

           her breath lightly caressing my face.
           {additive:off}
           Did she flick me with her finger??
           The expression on Star's face is one of light amusement. 
           Asterella::
           "There."
           MC:: 
           Star seems satisfied. And close to laughing.
           Asterella::
           "There really is no need to protect anyone, especially Szycrotic."
           MC::
           Star pushes my hair away and kisses my wounded forehead lightly.

           We are alone. Star and I.
           The kiss on the forehead burns more than the sting to my pride, or the finger flick.
           She is...beautiful.
           Regal, confident, and slightly sadistic.
           All the things a demon lord should be?
           I touch my forehead lightly.

Oh my god I am choking.
I need to calm down.
Asterella raises her eyebrows, standing up. 
Asterella::
"She seems pretty protective of you. Do I need to increase the punishment?"
MC::
I stand aghast. I don't want to add more to his pain...
Szycrotic::
"Oh yeah dommy mommy, give me the punishment I deserve."
MC::
He laughs heartily, walks up, and kisses Star on the forehead. 
With a wave as he opens the door, he replies.

MC::
We are alone. Star and I.
As if on cue, she strides confidently to me.
Merely feet away, she studies me. 
She is a bit shorter than me, but her presence of authority is palpable.
Despite myself, I feel myself wanting to surrender to her. 
She is every inch a Lord. 
Asterella::
"So, do you have a name?"
MC::
She lets the question hang there open. 
Oh!
"Name is MC, Lord Star."
I stammer it. 
I moan internally.
I am wrecking the first impression. 
Her face is unreadable. Her best poker face. 
This close, I can see that her underwear underneath are pretty revealing.
Almost transparent. 
I can smell lavendar and......brimstone?
She is that close. 
She nods and smiles a genuine smile. 
Asterella::
"That is a very nice name, MC."
{additive: on}
"Before we talk business, 
I would like to relax a bit.
Do you fancy some wine, Perhaps?"

MC::
Anything to break this trance. 
"Yes, please."
"That would be very nice. I am pretty thirsty, actually."
She motions to the couch gracefully.
Asterella::
"Please, be seated. I will bring the wine."
MC::
She moves to a table against the wall, cueing me to move.
I make my way to the soft, velvet couch. 
The whole room screams humble royalty, as if she has no need for gaudy reminders of who she is.
She knows.
Asterella::
"You know, as an intruder, I imagine you wouldn't expect this kind of hospitality."
"I don't see you as an intruder exactly."
MC::
I sit down on one side, giving her plenty of room. The book she was reading...
I can't read the title. 
{additive: on}
I lean forward more to try and see if I recognize the language, 
but it looks like gibberish to me.
Some old, archaic language, I think.
But I am no expert.
{additive:off}
Does...she know something?
"If you do not consider me an intruder, then who am I to you?"
I follow that up quickly.....
Maybe a bit too desperate.
"I can assure you, it was not intentional for me to be here."

She holds up one finger.

"Number one."

"You see, MC, 
you have piqued my interest.
I assure you, that is a good thing."

She pointedly makes direct eye contact.
"Way better than the alternative."

I audibly gulp a bit. She is scary and sensual at the same time.
"And the second thing?"
Star's eyes turn hungry.
Asterella::
"Second?"
MC::
She leans forward and places a hand on my thigh.
Asterella::
"You see, MC, you are exactly my type."
"We demons have a way of easing each other's minds."

She watches her hand lazily make circles on my thigh. 
Asterella::
"Intimate interactions help form bonds, that would be nigh to impossible in our realm."
MC::
I can't believe what I am hearing....
Is she asking for....
"Me?"
It was all I can say.
I take a deep pull of the wine, covering my blushing face behind the action.
