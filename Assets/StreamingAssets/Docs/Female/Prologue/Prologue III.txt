Narrator::
The window changes, becoming dark as midnight.
No one dares make a sound.
The quick chatter of the laptops betrays the sense of urgency and tension that permeates the room. 
{fadeinsound: Cliff Wood Tapping, .1}
Cliff leans on the back of Shirobi's chair, impatiently tapping on the wooden back.
On the screen, a diagnostic runs on the DIHI. 
Shirobi, pale as a ghost, just stares at the screen without looking at it. 
{moveChar: Shirobi, .85}
{moveChar: Cliff, .15}
Shirobi::
"I promised her, Sir. That she would be ok... I told her it would just be four days. And..."
Narrator::
Shirobi chokes back panic, sighing in defeat.
Shirobi::
<i>Crying won't bring her back safely...</i>
{additive: on}
"There are no thought patterns in any of the servers.
Is it possible just for the DIHI to just...
scramble her?"
{additive: off}
Narrator::
Cliff shakes his head. He refuses to accept that fate.
Cliff::
"We can't rule that out, but I'm sure the DIHI is working as intended."
{additive: on}
"Many tests have already been done:
six months of preparation on that chair.
Six whole months..."
{additive: off}
Narrator::
Cliff trails off, his body starting to shake. 
Cliff::
"She's just a kid dammit!!"
{fadeinsound: Cliff Fist Wood, 1} 
{additive: off}
Narrator::
{additive: on}
The sound of a fist, 
loud in the otherwise quiet room, 
causes the team to jump. 
{additive: off}
Cliff::
"If the press had even suspected something was wrong..." 
Narrator::
Cliff looks down at his fist, forcibly relaxing it.
Cliff::
{additive: on}
"It's ok. 
We've got four days to find her... 
Verify that test for me Shirobi, will you? I'm tired...
So tired."
{additive: off}
Narrator::
Cliff rubs the bridge of his nose in frustration.
{additive: on}
Shirobi, 
pale, and obviously worrying for his friend, 
visibly shakes his head and gets back to work.
{additive: off} 
Silence reigns as the techs systematically check ports, settings on the DIHI, and the laptops.
Several minutes pass. Suddenly, someone pipes up.
{additive: on}
A young lab tech, fresh out of internship, 
looks up from the laptop from across the room, 
her auburn hair a mess, betraying the long hours of preparation for this experiment.
{additive: off}
{moveChar: Becks, .55}
Becks::
"Sir, I think I found the problem."
Narrator::
She leans back in her chair and pivots, facing them.
Becks::
"It's a big one."
Narrator::
Cliff can barely contain the impatience and exhaustion in his voice.
Cliff::
"Becks just say it. What did you find?"
Narrator::
Becks opens her mouth, hesitates, then snaps it shut.
Becks::
"Sir, you need to see this yourself."
Narrator::
{additive: on}
Cliff approaches,
unsure what he is supposed to see.
A normal diagnostic is running on the screen. His brow furrows, and he looks at Becks.
{additive: off}
Cliff::
"The scan isn't even finished yet. What am I looking for?" 
"Becks?"
Becks::
"Look at the lan status."
Narrator::
Becks moves the mouse over and clicks open the network settings.
Becks::
"Here."
{anim: Becks, gm 05}
Narrator::
As Becks clicks on the network status, they both see the problem.
No local servers... none. One through ten should be there... 
One thing catches Cliff's attention, causing him to breathe in sharply.
The Lab Supervisor suddenly looks at Becks questionably, and Becks nods.
Becks::
"It has been connected the entire experiment."
Narrator::
Cliff starts pacing, mumbling to himself, the words unrecognizable, even to the lab crew. 
He pauses in his rambling and focuses his attention to Shirobi.
Panic, anger, and a light dose of despair paint his features clearly. 
Cliff::
"Good news, the DIHI's fine. MC was not scrambled at least."
Narrator::
{fadeoutsound: Fast Keyboard Typing, .5}
Shirobi stops typing, looking up. 
Cliff::
"That isn't the problem: The problem is the DIHI is not connected to the servers. It's connected to the internet."
Narrator::
{anim: Shirobi, kime1}
{anim: Cliff, kime2}
Shirobi groans as he places his head between his hands.
Shirobi::
"Ohhhhhh FUCK!"
Narrator::
Silence. Several seconds pass in dead silence.
Massaging his forehead, Shirobi's voice picks up.
Shirobi::
"Sir, do we even have a chance to find her in there? I mean she is the <i>only</i> human in the internet but..."
Narrator::
The old man, looking at the laptop's display, sighs and replies.
Cliff::
{additive: on}
"It's possible, 
but we would have to send AI into the code to search for her brain patterns, and <i>hope</i> her patterns do not alter too much. 
If they do, we won't be able to find her."
{additive: off}
"I pray she lands somewhere semi-safe."
"Will ransomware or malware hurt her? There are so many unknown dangers that we have no clue on..."
Narrator::
Shirobi, listening carefully, brightens up. 
{anim: Shirobi, idle}
Shirobi::
"I got it! The browser history! It's so simple!" 
{additive: on}
"We can start there. 
How does that sound Chief? 
It can at least focus our efforts. Youbtube is so <i>huge</i> now...
We wouldn't know where the AI actually dwells without being a part of the structure."
{additive: off}
Narrator:: 
Cliff nods, never taking his eyes off the screen, grim determination replacing panic.
Cliff::
"MC, she needs us." 
{additive: on}
"She will be brave, but clueless.
More alone than any woman has ever been. 
The only human in the digital world. 
I hope that is enough to find her."
{additive: off} 
Narrator::
His eyes focus on Shirobi. The command in his voice strong.
Cliff::
"Get MC's thought pattern impressions inputted into the mainframe and start training the AI."
"Hopefully, we can start a full search pattern in 12 hours."
Becks::
{anim: Becks, g m03}
"What about the press Sir?"
Narrator::
Cliff glances over at Becks.
Cliff:: 
"We have four days. Four days to find the answer."
"For now, we will play it off as typical secretive corporate lab techs." 
Narrator::
He ends the sentence with a bit of irony.
Cliff::
"We at least, can use that stereotype to buy us some time."
"In the meantime, try to figure out a good way to explain to the world what is happening." 
"If we can't find her by then, there will be some serious backlash on this."
Narrator::
Cliff's path clear, his confidence comes back.
Cliff::
"And get someone to do a complete diagnostic of the DIHI. Ensure the report is..."
Narrator::
As Cliff continues to push out instructions to his team, he couldn't help but feel a pang of incredible sadness. 
The kid is fresh out of college.
Chief actually knows the kid's parents, and they will be devastated to hear what happened to their daughter.
{additive: on}
The MC is calm, collected, with a quick wit. He muses.
A bright young woman to be sure,
but prone to jumping without looking.
{additive: off}
From her profile, she is pretty competent.
He hopes that whereever she is, she will be smart enough to pace herself and make careful decisions...
