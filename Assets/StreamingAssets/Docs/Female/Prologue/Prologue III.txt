Narrator::
No one dares make a sound.
The quick chatter of the laptops betray the sense of urgency and tension that permeates the room. 
{fadeinsound: Cliff Wood Tapping, .1}
Cliff::
Cliff leans on the back of Shirobi's chair, impatiently tapping on the wooden back.
Narrator::
On the screen, a diagnostic runs on the DIHI. 
Shirobi, pale as a ghost, just stares at the screen without looking at it. 
{moveChar: Shirobi, .85}
{moveChar: Cliff, .15}
Shirobi::
"I promised her, Sir. That she would be ok.... I told her it would just be four days. And..."
He chokes back panic, sighing in defeat.
Shirobi::
<i>Crying won't bring her back safely...</i>
{additive: on}
"There are no thought patterns in any of the servers.
Is it possible just for the DIHI to just.......
scramble her???"
{additive: off}
Cliff::
Cliff shakes his head. He refuses to accept that fate.
"We can't rule that out, but I am sure the DIHI is working as intended."
{additive: on}
"Many tests have already been done:
six months of preparation on that chair.
Six whole months........."
{additive: off}
"She is just a kid dammit!!"
{fadeinsound: Cliff Fist Wood, 1} 
{additive: off}
Narrator::
{additive: on}
The sound of a fist, 
loud in the otherwise quiet room, 
causes the team to jump. 
{additive: off}
Cliff::
"If the press had even suspected something was wrong..." 
Cliff looks down at his fist, forcibly relaxing it.
{additive: on}
"Its ok. 
We got four days to find her. 
Verify that test for me Shirobi, will you? I am tired.....
So very tired."
{additive: off}
Cliff rubs the bridge of his nose in tired frustration.
Narrator::
{additive: on}
Shirobi, 
pale, and obviously worrying for his friend, 
visibly shakes his head and gets back to work.
{additive: off} 
Silence reigns as the techs systematically check ports, settings on the DIHI, and the laptops.
Several minutes pass. Suddenly, someone pipes up.
{additive: on}
A young lab tech, fresh out of internship, 
looks up from the laptop from across the room, 
her auburn hair a mess, betraying the long hours of preparation for this experiment.
{additive: off}
{moveChar: Becks, .55}
Becks::
"Sir, I think I found the problem."
She leans back in her chair, and pivots, facing them.
"Sir, it's a big one."
Cliff::
Cliff, impatient, the sound of exhaustion in his voice, 
"Becks just say it. What did you find?"
Becks:: 
Becks opens her mouth, hesitates,  then snaps it shut.
"Sir, you need to see this yourself." 
Cliff::
{additive: on}
Cliff approaches,
unsure what he is supposed to see.
A normal diagnostic is running on the screen. His brow furrows, and he looks at Becks.
{additive: off}
"The scan isn't even finished yet. What am I looking for?" 
"Becks?"
Becks::
Becks, trying not to panic, motions with her head at the internet connection on the laptop.
Narrator::
There, plain as day, the wifi signal has five bars. 
Cliff::
The Lab Supervisor suddenly looks at Becks questionably, and Becks nods.
Becks::
"It has been connected the entire experiment."
"Sir?"
Cliff::
Cliff starts pacing, mumbling to himself, the words unrecognizable, even to the lab crew. 
He pauses in his rambling, and looks up at Shirobi.
Panic, anger, and a light dose of despair paints his features clearly. 
"Good news, the DIHI is fine. It didn't kill MC."
Narrator::
{fadeoutsound: Fast Keyboard Typing, .5}
Shirobi stops typing, looking up. 
Cliff::
"That isn't the problem: The DIHI is not connected to the servers, but the internet."
Shirobi::
Shirobi groans as he places his head between his hands.
"Ohhhhhh FUCK!"
Silence. Several seconds pass in dead silence.
Massaging his forehead, Shirobi's voice picks up.
"Sir, do we even have a chance to find her in there? I mean she is the ONLY human in the internet but...."
Cliff::
The old man, looking at the laptop's screen, sighs and replies.
{additive: on}
"It's possible, 
but we would have to send AI into the code to search for her brain patterns, and HOPE her patterns do not alter too much. 
If they do, we won't be able to find her."
{additive: off}
"I pray she lands somewhere semi-safe."
"Will ransomware or malware hurt her? There are so many unknown dangers that we have no clue on...."
Shirobi::
Shirobi, listening carefully, brightens up. 
"I got it! We can check the browser history of the laptop and check all the websites it was connected to!" 
{additive: on}
"We can start there. 
How does that sound Chief? 
I mean it's still a ton. Youbtube is HUGE now. 
And we wouldn't know where an AI actually dwells without being a part of a structure."
{additive: off}
Cliff::
Cliff nods, never taking his eyes off the screen, grim determination replacing panic.
"MC needs us." 
{additive: on}
"She will be brave, but clueless.
More alone than any woman has ever been. 
The only human in the digital world. 
I hope that is enough to find her."
{additive: off} 
His eyes focus on Shirobi. The command in his voice strong.
"Get MC's thought pattern impressions inputted into the mainframe and start training the AI."
"Hopefully we can start a full search pattern in 24 hours."
Becks::
"What about the press Sir?"
Cliff::
Cliff glances over at Becks.
"We have four days to have an answer."
"For now, we will play it off as typical secretive corporate lab techs." 
He ends the sentence with a bit of sarcastic contempt.
"We, at least, can use that stereotype to buy us some time."
"In the meantime, you try to figure out a good way to explain to the world what is happening." 
"If we can't find her by then, there will be some serious backlash on this."
Cliff's path clear, his confidence comes back.
"And get someone to do a full sweep of the DIHI and ensure the report is...."
As Cliff continues to push out instructions to his team, he couldn't help but feel a pang of incredible sadness. 
The kid was fresh out of college.
He actually knows the kid's parents, and they will be devastated to hear what happened to their daughter.
{additive: on}
The MC is calm, collected, with a quick wit.
A bright young woman to be sure,
but prone to jumping without looking.
{additive: off}
From her profile, she is pretty competent.
He hopes that whereever she is, she will be smart enough to pace herself and make careful decisions.......
