MC::
<i>The brain sucking chair....</i>
<i>The lab techs cringe when I say that, but I don't care.</i>
<i>Mechanical whirring of laptops, server fans, and the hum of the EM fields surrounding the chair resonates inside my skull.</i>
<i>The reporters haven't noticed me yet.</i>
<i>I swallow nervously.</i>
<i>Even though I am around all of these people, I feel like I am truly alone.</i>
<i>I take a few steps into the room hesitantly.</i>

John::
"MC! Are you ok? You don't look very chipper."
<i>John laughs, the sound straining to combat the tension in the air.</i>
"Must be nerve wracking for billions of people to watch you make history, am I right?"
MC::
<i>Why do they have to make the lighting so harsh in here?! </i>
<i>And why did he have to point out how many are watching?! </i>
<i>I control my breathing.</i>
"Yes, I am ok."
<i>I paint on my best smile. Nothing is wrong, reporter guy.</i>
"The unknown of a new dimension? Count me in!"
"I am just a bit nervous with everyone looking at me."

"So much has been done to make this happen.
I am excited to get to work! I won't let you down!"

{moveChar: Cliff, .25}  
<i>Eyes start to adjust, and I notice Cliff, the lead project manager, behind the press, arms crossed and a look of concern on his features.</i>
<i>Why is no one saying anything??!!</i>
<i>Suddenly uncomfortable, I keep silent, watching everyone study me.</i>
{additive: on}
<i>There is a surprising amount of people whispering in this tiny room!</i>
<i>I feel very small, wanting to compress myself, but there is nowhere to go,</i>

{additive: off}
<i>In my pocket, sits the letter from mom I received this morning, full of praise and excitement.</i>

<i>The NDA is permanent.</i>
<i>It it a very dangerous experiment, and very few would volunteer.</i>
<i>On a positive note, I could stream in the internet to my fans.</i>
<i>I may be a small streamer, but I was one of the few that wouldn't go through the process of copying myself.</i>
<i>It just doesn't feel right to the people watching.</i>
<i>So when given a chance, I leapt at it.</i>
<i>Imagine if people can transport into the internet at will in the future because of this experiment?</i>

<i>Scratching the back of my neck,</i>
<i>I scan the small crowd through the blinding lights to find Shirobi,</i>
<i>the Lab Intern.</i>
{additive: off}
<i>I know him from a few of my classes.</i>
<i>He is too tall for his own good, and a little dorky, but a good guy.</i>
<i>And..... he is hilariously cute when he pushes his glasses up the bridge of his nose.</i>
<i>He may be, to most, a slightly annoying person, but to me, he is a trustworthy friend. </i>
<i>I spy him, PDA in hand, watching my expression, his face betraying his worry.</i>
{additive: on}
<i>I smile my best smile,</i>
<i>which always makes him blush a bit (it's really funny and he knows I like to tease him),</i>
<i>and his posture abruptly relaxes.</i>
{additive: off}
<i>I could hear some of the press chuckling over that.</i>
"Ready when you are Shibi." <i>, I say, mockingly serious, saluting him.</i>
<i>He also hates when I call him that. He takes himself way too seriously sometimes.</i> 
Shirobi::
<i>He nods sagely, a slight smile curving his lips.</i>
<i>He motions towards the DIHI.</i> 
{additive: on}
"I am in charge of watching all your vitals.
Four days of testing and out ok?
No trying to stay in the servers MC......"
{additive: off}
MC::
<i>My eyebrows raise of their own accord.</i> 
"I will be good, I promise. Wouldn't want you to get worried."

<i>The sound of the DIHI suddenly changes, and the feel of ionizing in the air increases.<.i>
{fadeinsound: DIHI Up Close, 1}
<i>The whole room VIBRATES.</i>
<i>There is no other word for it.</i>
<i>It feels like the chair is creating it's own realm inside this room.</i>
<i>I watch as the press sits down behind the observation glass, grabbing coffee and chatting. </i>
<i>For a brief second, I hesitate.</i>
<i>Ok, THAT is a little unnerving.</i>
Shirobi::
"The process is pretty mundane actually." 
{additive: on}
"Your body will be inert,
breathing, 
heartbeat, 
but no one there. 
We will store it immediately in stasis. 
Don't worry, MC, you will be well taken care of. 
I promise."

MC::
<i>I center myself in front of the Portal to the Digital Realm.</i>
<i>It feels so surreal, so much so that I feel detachment from the situation.</i>
<i>A small part of me is paniking, screaming at me to leave the room.</i>
<i>It's too dangerous to stay!</i>
<i>The vibrations start to resonate even in my lungs, like they do in a concert when you are too close to the speakers. </i>
<i>LEAVE. NOW.</i>
<i>It is starting to affect my state of mind. I shove the fear down, and take a step. </i>
<i>Tendrils of coolant mists emanuate from the contraption.</i>
Shirobi::
<i>Shirobi moves to the console next to the chair.</i>
<i>Shutting the scanners down opens the path to the chair. The hum lowers in volume a bit. </i>
"Ok here we go MC."
"Have fun."
"I will see you on the other side ok?"
<i>Shirobi, looking a little nervous himself, motions to the seat.</i>
MC:: 
<i>I swallow down my fear, realizing it is already too late to go back.</i>
{additive: on}
<i>I take another step, and the resonation increases,</i>
<i>humming,</i>

<i>my body's rhythm attempting to match.</i>
{additive: off}
<i>The light pulses, as if alive, eating the darkness of the rest of the room.</i>
<i>Even the floor is vibrating.</i>
<i>I take another step, pivot and sit down.</i> 
<i>It resembles a ride in the center of a hurricane.<i>
<i>Nausea starts to rise in my stomach.</i>
"I am ready, Shibi! Please take care of me!"
{additive: on}
<i>I feel fingers on my forehead,</i>
<i>cool to the touch,</i>
<i>gently push my head back against the throbbing headrest.</i>
<i>The calming touch allows me to breathe. </i>
{additive: off}
<i>My eyes meet Shirobi's. He smiles briefly one more time. </i>
{fadeinsound: DIHI Power Up, 1}
Shirobi::
"Close your eyes......baka."
MC::
<i>I comply.</i> 
"Don't try and sneak a kiss...." 
<i>I manage wryly.</i>
<i>It is more fear forcing me to speak. To ease the tension.</i>
Shirobi::
"Hush you."
MC::
<i>I could hear him fiddle with switches and tap the screen of his Pad.</i>
<i>Odd how loud it is, but I can hear that?</i>
<i>I honestly don't know what to expect, and that unknown scares me more as the seconds move forward.</i>
