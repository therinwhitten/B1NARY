<i>No body, yet there is a direction.</i>
<i>No motion, yet the sensation of forward motion.</i>
<i>Like falling down a waterfall, right before you hit terminal velocity.</i>
<i>A waterfall through a straw.....if there is such a thing.</i>
"It is so......peaceful."
<i>No words come out. I have no lungs.</i>
<i>My heartbeat thumps loudly, even though I don't think I have a body.</i>
<i>Nausea hits fast, as I suddenly lurch to the side.</i>
<i>Speed picks up. I feel excitement rise up in my "chest."</i>
"So this is what it feels like to travel through a cable...."
<i>This has to be this sensation.</i>
{additive: on}
<i>Time has no power here.</i>
<i>I feel it.</i>
<i>I KNOW IT.</i>
{additive: off}
<i>The trip will probably be in the blink of an eye.</i>
<i>It feels like it has already been several minutes.</i>

<i>Force erupts.</i>
<i>My brain jolts.</i>
<i>No pain, but my brain starts to tear apart.</i>
<i>I tear up in fear.</i>
<i>Will I simply cease to be? Not even able to see what is on the other side?</i>
"NOOOOOO!"
<i>With all of my will, I focus. HARD.</i>
<i>I simply refuse. Force my brain to form cohesion.</i>
<i>Another shift, more violent than before.</i>
<i>I almost lose it.</i>
<i>I am ME!</i>
<i>If I did have a mouth, I would be laughing incoherently.</i>
"HOLD TOGETHER."
