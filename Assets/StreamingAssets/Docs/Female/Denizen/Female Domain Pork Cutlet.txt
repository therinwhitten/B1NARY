//(audio: steps on gravel)
MC::
Train tracks meander through the valley, combining to meet at what I assume is a train station. There is a train there now! Odd. It's rather small for a normal train. 
There are only 5 cars, and the engine looks like a High Speed Rail. 
I pick up my pace. The coloring scheme reminds me of someone...
It's a win win! Train Station <i>and</i> that means vending machines!
Food, a traveling hub, all in one place! Maybe some information. A train is parked with it's lights on. I'm sure someone is there. 
The hunger gnawing at my belly is getting to me. It feels almost like a black hole consuming itself. Not going to lie to you, this hunger is starting to scare me. It's unnatural.
//(Audio: FAster jog)
I'm almost jogging down the remainder of the hill, scanning for people. No one looks to be at the station. No people boarding, no staff, no conductors. It's almost like a ghost train.
Even the fear I push back. I see the vending machines! Locked on Target!
Opposite wall to the train, sits a group of vending machines. My mouth is already watering as I hit the entrance. 
//Audio: Gravel Jog Stop
With the grace of desperation, I leap over the rotating bars in one deft movement. No staff here. Tough luck.
Breaking the law makes me feel uneasy, but my hunger could care less. 
//Audio: Running on pavement
Making a beeline to the machines, I spy canned coffee and sandwiches! I'm barely able to stop my forward motion, my hands smacking the glass to sheild me from the sudden stop. 
//Audio: Stop Running, heavy breathing
Breathing hard, my nose <i>inches</i> from a tuna salad sandwich inside, I scan the choices. 
My wallet is magically in my hand, pulling out a wad of yen. I start sliding bills in. 
Tuna, chicken, hamburger steak, mankatsu, niman cutlet. If I had doubts this was Japan, these choices confirms the truth. 
//audio: vending machine drop
Mouth watering now, I select mankatsu. Change tumbles into the receptacle, and I snatch it up as the sandwich drops. 
"Come to momma! I'm about to eat'cha!"
I rip the wrapper, fishing for the pork. It's hot to the touch, with the aroma wafting into my nose. 
I take my first bite since waking up.
The soft breading and the firm pork, in perfect balance, explode flavor into my mouth. I can't help but moan a little to sexually as I inhale the first couple of bites. 
"So gooood!"
Still chewing, I put more coins in for another sandwich. I know my hunger might be giving me bias, but this food tastes amazing! To come from a vending machine and taste this fresh...
//Audio: light footsteps. slowing
//audio: vending machine drop.
Already on the second half of the pork sandwich, I pick up the tuna sandwich I just selected. I think I can get away with eating two and taking four back with me. It's not very healthy, but it's not like anyone cares here. 
I sink my teeth into about the fourth bite of the second half , staring at all the drink choices. Oh, cold pressed coffee with milk? There's even hot coffee? Definately Japan.
Scanning the other choices, I notice movement through the refelction of the glass. A delicate womans face, framed in white and frost blue hair, staring hungrily <i>back</i> at me.
We lock eyes through the reflection...
Is her mouth watering?
//Audio: Heartbeat thump
My heart stops. I freeze in mid chew. 
Train Conductor::
"Oh! Good Choice! The niman cutlet is <i>amazing</i>! I stop here <i>just</i> for that sandwich..."
MC::
The reflection remarks quietly, happily. The tone changes to a slightly more threatening tone. 
Train Conductor::
"Gee, I hope there is still a few left."
MC::
I say nothing. I swallow my bite, and step to the side, clutching my golden food next to my chest. 
She has to be a train station worker. She has the High Speed Rail uniform. The sun glints off of her glasses. 
Wait. 
It's her!
She takes my spot, nodding her head gracefully. Her nod feels like a victory?
//Audio: Coins in the vending machine
Without looking, she continues.
Train Conductor::
"Are you new here? I've never seen you here before."
MC::
That dark grey and gold uniform, the custom glasses. 
She reaches down gently, and grabs two sandwiches. Suddenly, she turns to me, startling me. The conductor hands me my tuna sandwich.
Train Conductor::
"...You forgot your sandwich."
MC::
Her voice. Quiet and sure. 
This is, without a doubt, Aoi Mikyuki. 
{changeName: Train Conductor, Aoi}
As a budding VTuber, I know who she is. I've watched a few live streams. Her content is funny, relaxed in nature. 
An AI made for Japanese High Speed Rail to help out customers on the trains. Some marketing for the AI exploded in popularity and it fostered the creation of the AI as a VTuber. 
She is well known for playing a ton of mystery  and puzzle games.
On stream at least, she has a touch of yandere in her. That's just an act though...
Is this <i>the</i> Aoi Miyuki though?
The possibility calms my seizing nerves enough to speak. 
"Thanks. I'm just really hungry. It's been a rough day.", my voice comes out squeaking and quiet. 
If I wasn't so worried about my situation, I would be totally fangirling right now. 
Aoi looks a bit uncomfortable, absently playing with the packaging of her sandwich. 
"I'm sorry, has anyone told you that you look exactly like Aoi Miyuki?" My fingers keep trying to open the tuna sandwich here and now. 
She blinks, looking a touch off.  Then, she smiles and looks directly at me. 
Aoi::
"I would hope so. I <i>am</i> Aoi Miyuki. Unless... Have you seen look alikes around?"
MC::
She purses her lips thoughtfully as she stares at me. 
Aoi::
"Do I know you? You <i>do</i> look kind of familiar. And you are?"
MC::
I feel a bit of heat reaching my cheeks. 
"I'm sorry. I haven't been myself today. Name is MC. It's a pleasure to meet you!"
I proffer my hand. 
Studying my outreaching hand, she takes it. Her face softens a bit more. I realize there was a touch of tension in her stance before. 
Her grip tightens into a hearty shake. 
Aoi::
"It's very nice to meet you. Like I said before, I'm just here for the sandwich. I didn't mean to make you jump. To be honest..."
MC::
She pauses, gazing around the station.
Aoi::
"I don't think I've ever seen anyone here. I usually just grab my chow and go."
MC::
I bite down on my tuna sandwich, shocking myself. It appears I already opened it, eating mindlessly. Aoi laughs lightly. 
Aoi::
"Hungry? I got time. Why don't you hop on the train and have a seat? I know you were grabbing more food, so have at it! I will go brew some tea for us."
MC::
With a motion, she points to the open door on the bullet train. 
//(Audio: Swallow sounds and the crackly sound of sandwich wrapper.)
I nod, finishing the last bite of my tuna sandwich, the crinkle of the wrapper loud. 
I have time to. Besides, this is Aoi! 
"Sure! Let me get a bit more food to take home, and I will join you.", I reply sheepishly.
"I still haven't found the store yet. So..."
She is already heading back to the train, answering without looking. 
Aoi::
"Perfectly understandable MC."
MC::
Back at the vending machine, I grab a few more sandwiches randomly for a bit more variety. Drinks too. Not too keen on fizzly drinks but a couple of colas is ok.  Besides I dont' remember drinking Japanese branded cola.
"Kawaii!",  I gush a bit. 
Aoi <i>is</i> cute. And so polite, even to a stranger. 
I feel the red assault my cheeks again. I <i>have</i> to try and compose myself. This is getting a touch out of hand. 
Filling her in on what I'm doing here might not be the best idea. The information is not mine to give. I can't just lie to her though. If she's the real deal, then I am <i>not</i> on the test server. 
Where exactly? 
Then again, if she <i>is</i> on the servers, she would be here by my mind summoning her. Which means, in a nutshell..
"I'm talking to myself."
Which one though? A figment of my imagination or the real Aoi Miyuki?
Starting to strain my last two braincells. Let's just have some tea and find out, shall we?
// Audio: steps
The strange hunger vanished as if a switch turned off the time I swallowed the last bite of the first sandwich. Still, it doesn't hurt to have a bit more. 
Arms full of drinks and sandwiches, I stroll carefully to the train. 
As I get closer, the details come out. Five cars in total, including the engine at the front. All of them have the white, blue, and green theme of the new Japan High Speed Rail. You can't even spy the wheels unless you get too close. 
Everything to maximize speed, it seems. And the car she went too looks to be the business class, near the very front. I can't hear anything, as if the train itself runs whisper quiet. 
I peek my head into the open door, noticing Aoi coming back from the front of the car with a plate with a Tea Kettle and two cups. As she spies me, she snorts openly, trying to stifle her laugh. 
Aoi::
"Do you need some help there? I mean, you could have asked for a bag, MC."
MC::
I blush a bit. 
"Well, I didn't want to impose any. Already getting some tea, after all."
"I kind of didn't consider grabbing a backpack from home."
My tone is apologetic. 
She quickly put the tea down. 
Aoi::
Come on in and have a seat, I will get that bag for you. Be right back."
MC::
She leaves with a graceful stride. As I plop all the food and drink on the table, I sit down, having a look around. 
//Audio: Put down items on table, Rustling sounds of a cupboard. 
Plush leather seats, full size tables with a single flower vase bolted into the center. Looks like a display terminal per seat to watch news, weather, ect. 
Further towards the front of the car, is what looks like a mini bedroom, with a small kitchenette. 
Aoi, who is now standing on a stool, is reaching into one of the top compartments over what appears to be a folded bed. 
<i>Stop...looking...at...her...butt...</i>
Aoi is small, but lithe and well shaped. Her uniform accentuates the curves well, and I have to constantly look away. She has no cares at all. 
Aoi::
"Ah, there we go!"
MC::
I can barely hear her muffled voice. Her arm shoots out from inside the overhead compartment, fisting a plastic bag. Her head follows shortly after.
Aoi::
"Victory! I <i>knew</i> I had a couple somewhere!"
"I bought some ramen the other day, and just didn't get around to throwing the bag into recycling."
MC::
Pausing, she glaces at me vexingly. 
Aoi::
"I know it's digital, but good habits are good habits. Remember to recycle, k?"
MC::
I nod my thanks.
She hops down with a light agility. 
Aoi::
"Now, let's have that tea! I think I nailed this brew!"
MC::
She glides to where I am sitting, handing me the bag. 
//Audio: Plastic bag
"Thanks, Aoi. I should have prepared a bit better."
She sits down carefully, grabbing the kettle and pouring the tea with a practiced air. 
//Audio: pouring tea, and tinkle of tea cups. 
Aoi::
"So, MC, if you don't mind my asking: why would you come to the train station for food instead of the local Lawsons? Is the train station closer?"
MC::
The flower scent of the jasmine tea wafts into my nostrils as she hands me my cup. I sniff reflexively. The warmth of the cup emanates into the palm of my hand as I search for sugar. 
How cute! A little bow with tweezers and sugar cubes. 
I slide my cup over and start adding sugar. 
// audio: drop of cubes into tea
"Just up the hill, actually. Not far."
Should I ask her about her streaming?  
"Just moved in this morning, and kind of forgot about snatching some snacks."
Need something to stir. I look around the table. 
I feel a cool hand on my forearm, it's so dainty! 
Aoi is holding a spoon. As I take it, I meet her eyes. She is genuinely curious. I end up taking the spoon with a bit more shyness that I really want to show, and stir the tea conciously.
//Audio: Sip
I take a sip, and the boldness of the flavor comforts my soul. It makes the whole world feel a bit more real for some reason. Careful. She looks and acts like Aoi, but I can't confirm.
Make it sound casual.
"So... where are you headed? You mentioned you were going somewhere?"
In mid sip you can see her thinking. 
Aoi::
Oh. This is breakfast for me. I'm about to stream on twatch. Just haven't decided on a game to play yet. HMMMM."
MC::
Twatch? Did she just say...
I have to be online! This is so awesome!
Shit! Shit! Shit!
I'm not supposed to be here yet!
Excitement battles with crippling fear. I need to verify. Test her somehow. Shoving both emotions down, I think, expertly hiding my feelings in my cup.
Looking from the safety of said cup, I really look at her. The way she frowns at her sandwich, to the way she looks outside, lost in thought.  Every single movement screams Aoi Miyuki.
"Streaming huh? Do you stream from this train?" Yes, the whole train is deserted, same as the station itself. This train  does look like a few of her overlays. 
She looks directly at me.
Aoi::
"Of course I do. There is a game that just released I'm considering.  Just not sure whether I should play it online or not."
MC::
She frowns, pouting.
Aoi::
"I'm sure <i>someone</i> will try and spoil it."
MC::
I laugh weakly.
"Yeah that can be a pain. There's always back seat gamers. If I wanted help, I would ask for it!"
I exclaim this, full of energy. I feel her. <i>So many times!</i> Why can't they just enjoy it with me? 
Aoi::
"You stream too?  Your avatar looks interesting! What kind of vibe are you going for?", she studies me intently.
MC::
Too fast! I need to reel this in. Dammit, got caught up in the moment. 
I laugh ruefully, my hands up in defense. 
"Oh no, not professionally or seriously. I stream for my friends from time to time. My mutuals can be some major trolls sometimes."
She chuckles. 
Aoi::
"Well I have my fair share of backseat gamers. I try to ignore them. My mods mute them pretty fast."
MC::
Compressed recollection flashes in her eyes.
Aoi::
"Speaking of mods. I need to DM them to make sure they are ready to go."
MC::
With a flick of her wrist, a transparent floating display panel pops up directly in front of her, to which she immediately starts typing on a holographic  keyboard on the table, nudging the tea cup back a bit. 
She smirks fondly.
Aoi::
"They are normally the reason I am late. Don't tell them I said said that."
MC::
Watching her type... How did she do that? What interface is that? I am <i>in</i> this world. Can I even pull up an interface? 
Let's lay this out.
{additive: on}
First: I'm here. I'm not on a sealed server. The data points to that. Aoi being here points to that. 
Second: I can't access the closed server because it's not connected to the internet. I haven't tried to use the laptop as an interface yet.
{additive: off}
Should I try? 
It's worth a shot!
Now...
Aoi finishes the last sentence to a message and closes the whole interface, grabbing the remains of her sandwich in the same motion. 
"Aoi?"
Aoi::
"Hmm?"
MC::
Chewing on a bite of sandwich, she looks at me.
"Where can this train go? Do you actually go anywhere?"
Careful. Trying to seem <i>only</i> curious. 
Aoi::
I go the twatch server mainly... Huh. Now that you mention it. I'm pretty sure I can go to all kinds of places."
"Well, almost daily to twatch. Some days I skip."
MC::
Interesting...
"Is there any maps? Have you gone so far to set up any cool map overlays?"
Aoi::
"You can use one?! Yes!"
MC::
Eagerness paints her entire face like a second skin. She reaches across the table towards the window, where a small box sits. When she cracks the lid, she pulls out what looks like a map.
Aoi::
"I worked on this during my off time! It's my train schedule!"
MC::
Her face takes on a more serious tone.
Aoi::
"Now that full dive VR is a thing, I love to have roleplay a bit. Have a copy. Maybe you can use my train sometimes. That would be fun!"
MC::
Her smile brightens up the whole train car...
Aoi::
"I will even take your ticket Miss."
MC::
She waggles a finger, then bursts into a low chuckle. 
I take the carefully folded map. This is my golden ticket. Almost too good to be true. I open it. 
It's beautiful, colors popping, details covering every square inch. I see all kinds of places: theatres, grocery stores, bowling alleys, parks, and Team Buildings?
What?
"Aoi, the buildings called Team Buildings. Are they named after Twatch Teams?" This is probably a stupid question. 
Finishing her last bite, speaking past a nice big chunk, she replies,
Aoi::
"Oh the Twatch Teams have buildings here. Like office buildings? It's kind of cool, to be honest. In fact, there is a whole section of the twatch server just for those office buildings.  It's incredibly easy to get lost there."
MC::
She points at a spot on my map with a pinky.
With a look of mock seriousness...
Aoi::
"Good thing someone smart gave you a map huh? Imagine you going without one and getting lost?"
MC::
"This is amazing! Can I get a ride to twatch tommorow?"
Imagine a whole downtown of VTubers? I think I have a plan for tommorow. I start folding the map carefully.
Aoi smiles warmly.
Aoi::
"Sounds like fun! I don't remember the last time someone has been on this train with me..."
MC::
Her eyes turn to literal stars.
Aoi::
"I get to actually be a real Train Conductor here!"
MC::
First time seeing this right in front of me, it's shocking.  Awesome nonetheless.
I lean forward.
"I'll even let you get me a bag of peanuts. I will need a ticket though right?" I look around. "Yeah where would we get one?"
I feel a warm hand in mine. Blushing despite the situation, I look down to see Aoi deposit a golden ticket into the palm of my hand.  
Touched by Aoi Miyuki... NO Fangirling!
"This is... a permanent ticket?!" The excitement is tangible in the air, as if you could pluck it down and hug it. 
Pocketing the ticket, I gulp down the last bit of tea. Have to hide the blush!
"I really enjoyed the tea Aoi. I will see you tommorow then!"
Smiling at her, I pick up my bag of sandwiches and drinks, and turn to leave. 
She looks like she knows why I am cutting it short and trying not to laugh I bet. 
Aoi::
"Don't forget your wallet tommorow. Lot's of shopping to do at the Twatch Server. Ok?"
MC::
She already looks like she is preparing to leave. I should leave her to it. 
// Audio: door closing and stepping
I step out, and watch the door close.
//Audio: Toot Toot
I yelp, almost leaping out of my skin. I feel my whole body spasm from the shock, picking up my pace <i>away</i> from the train. 
Once I get a bit of distance, I look back. 
"Barely a sound from the engine. What tech they must have."
In fact, the sounds of the wheels are far louder than the engine itself, grating as the train starts it's forward movement. I can no longer see Aoi in the car. The windows tinted like magic as the train leaps forward. 
In less than 10 seconds, its gone, around the bend and out of the train station. Silence reigns again in the empty station. 
Above where the train vanished, looms a large, dark storm, moving fast. 
// Audio: Single bird Chirp
It's late afternoon. Need to store this stuff in the fridge, if there even is one? I have alot to do. First, the trip home. 
"I need to beat that storm home."
I quicken my pace out of the station...
