MC::
I smack my lips. 
"Of all the things you could have removed, why wasn't one of them morning breath?", I complain. 
It's cold, and wet, with the sun peeking over the forested hills. 
I sip on my canned coffee, hot and fresh from the vending machine. The heat the only source of heat in the area. 
Where am I? 
The train station. 
I glance at my watch. 6:45am. 
Forget the fact that I only had my watch as my alarm clock. Forget the fact that it almost didn't wake me up after going off for 30 mins. 
I was so out of it. I must have tripped over my clothes at least three times...
I finally settled on something with a bit more warmth: pair of blue jeans, a brown turtleneck, and a leather backpack. It was a bit smaller. 
Didn't even have time to search for a jacket. I was running late. 
I stifle another yawn and take another sip. 
No, I wasn't going to wear a kimono at the train station. I do plan to check out a new area.
"If this train doesn't show up, I will <i>not</i> be happy."
Another glance at the time: 10 minutes left.  According to the board, train should be arriving any minute now. 
And I might meet Aoi Miyuki...
Aoi Miyuki, one of the first AI based Vtubers of our time. She streams at least twice a week. She doesn't even have to. 
Her main role is to be the Assistant AI on High Speed Rail in Japan. The promotion for her became so viral, she just started streaming. And now? 
She is one of the large VTubers on Twatch. Many come to Japan just to ride the Rail and experience her in her natural habitat.  Many theories surround her. Most are silly though. 
One that keeps popping up is her sentience. There is still debate whether or not AI has reached human levels of self awareness. 
She is simply amazing. You <i>never</i> know what she is going to say. Ever.
"And I can't gush to her!", I pout to the air. 
The sky cleared up overnight, with puddles of water sporadically scattered everywhere. I was desperately looking for an umbrella this morning, only to find out I wouldn't need one. 
I should get one if I can today, and a burner phone of some sort?
GPS, Contacts, Call/Text, and note taking. I tick them off with my hand. 
Am I really preparing for the long term here? 
I check my watch again, impatient. I'm quickly losing hope to be home in four days. It's scary, but acceptable to a point. Sure, things are cloudy here and there, yet I don't feel weird or inhuman. 
My mind feels as sharp this morning as it did yesterday. Honestly, if I wasn't so excited to explore, I would probably be panicking. 
In three days, Digital Horizons will have to either make up a story, or tell the world they can't find me.  I need to keep tabs on my twatter to see if they mention me publically. Poor Cliff and Shirobi.
Right now, I live in a crystal box: I can see everything outside, but I'm stuck behind a wall.  And yet...
It doesn't feel so bad. Not yet, anyway. I have food, a nice place to sleep, and places to explore. My brain hasn't started melting, and my body seems to be healthy. 
How long would it take a healthy brain's patterns to decay? Years maybe? 
So, I should be ok for now. I have some time to collect data and report back my findings. Plus, with Aoi, it's possible that I can maybe... Visit other Vtubers in this world? 
Imagine meeting Asterella Star, Fefe, or Comrade Del?  I have a few I would like to meet, for sure!
//(Audio: Train Horn)
There it is!
I'm standing up before I realize it, slinging my backpack over my shoulder with one hand, coffee can in the other. I have a bit of food, water, and all my money. I shoud be ok.
// (Audio: Train Whistle, louder and the sounds of brakes screeching)
"That train is <i>fast!</i>"
It sounds even closer. How fast do they move?
// (Audio: Heartbeat thump)
"Don't freak out! Don't!" I can't look like a kook in front of one of my favorite Vtubers!
Calm Down MC, she's probably <i>just</i> a program. Keep that in your head. Even if Aoi is aware...
It comes around the bend. 
With the colors of the Japan Speed Rail Company, the train all silver with light blues slows down as it comes into the station. 
Even this morning, there is no life in the train station. No passengers, no crew. Just a quiet pickup with the birds chirping. 
// Audio: Brakes
The main engine pulls beyond my sight...
"There's no driver..."
Ah... I can't help it. Curiosity overwhelms my fear. 
I pace forward to try and look inside the cabin of the engine itself. It's a few cars down, and the train is almost at a full stop. 
Reaching a good vantage point, I tiptoe to gain more height, scanning. Yep, there is no one in there. 
Of course. 
Just when I start to feel like this is a real place, I get dumped right back into wonderland. That is the digital world. 
// Audio: Train Door Sliding open.
A door slides up several cars down, and inadvertantly draws my eyes to spy a small and lithe beauty stepping out of the train. White and frost blue hair glimmer in the morning sun. She looks to be in her mid twenties.
She's wearing a Japan Speed Rail Uniform, and humming a tune to herself, and I immediately recognize the tune. 
There she is. In the flesh: Aoi Miyuki. She's way shorter in the flesh! She crops some hair behind her ear as she looks up and down the train and freezes when she spots me, her blue eyes widening in surprise.
I try to speak, but can't. I'm froze. Oh no!
Say <i>something</i>!
Aoi::
"Oh hello, I didn't see you there!"
MC:: 
The smile is polite. 
Aoi::
"I usually come here <i>just</i> for sandwiches. I didn't expect to pick someone up here, you know?"
MC::
I bow suddenly, deep and formal. 
"Please, I read the bulletin board, and would like a ride?" <i>Do I sound desperate? Do I?</i>
"I would like to go shopping for somethings..." I trail off. Why MC?! 
I keep my head bowed.
I hear a 'phhht'.
Aoi::
"Of course silly, this is a train station. I don't give people rides often, at least from this hub. This station's normally empty."
MC::
As I look up, I see her patient smile again. Do I see a touch of excitement in her eyes? 
Aoi::
"You just brightened up my day. Thank you! Now... to business."
MC::
Suddenly, her eyes turn almost predatory. 
And she 'stalks' the vending machines.
Aoi::
"I hope you didn't take the last pork cutlet. I love those sandwiches! I get them almost every morning."
MC::
I almost snort. She is literally acting like a hunter, stalking the machine. It calms me down a bit. For her, this is normal on stream.
"Um should I wait? Or? My name is..."
She stops, puts one finger to her mouth, and sushes me. The smile is only on her lips. 
Aoi::
"<i>After</i> acquisition, we can talk."
MC::
She continues up to the machine, my gaping mouth dry. 
// (Vending machine releases the sandwich with the clink of coins and the sandwich falling to the receptacle)
Aoi reaches down and snatches the sandwich. With a practiced movement, she opens the packaging with a practiced motion. For a second, she stands there taking in the flavor.
With a mouthful of pork, she replies.
Aoi::
"Of course! My name is Aoi. Nice to meet you!"
MC::
Her eyes smile as she takes another bite.
Aoi::
"I don't think I've ever picked someone up from here. You're my first customer from this prefecture."
MC::
She turns to face me. 
Aoi::
"Oh! Did anyone get hurt during the Typhoon last night?"
MC::
I blink in confusion despite myself. She...knows? She follows the world that closely? I laugh. 
"Just soaked us like wet dogs."
She nods as she takes another bite. 
Aoi::
"In some situations that isn't a bad thing, you know?"
MC::
She smiles and nods at the train.
Aoi::
"Need a ride? I assume you aren't here for just the vending machines...wait... are you?"
MC::
Her face takes on a playful pout.
"Yes, I would love to get a ride. I did have dinner last night, thanks to that vending machine."
Still chewing, she continues.
Aoi::
"I love the sandwiches here, they hit different here. I don't know why. Perfect daily routine for my pre stream prep."
MC::
She pauses, looking at me.
Aoi::
"Oh, If you want, I can hold off streaming until I drop you off if you don't feel comfy being on stream. Chat would probably pester you."
//Audio: Aoi Laughs
MC:
Bating my breath, I remain silent. Should I? Live chat? It would be an easy way to make my location known. But if the wrong people see me...
Too many unknowns right now. But I have an out. And frankly, being in front of all of Aoi's viewers would wrack my nerves. 
I nod. "Thanks for the consideration. I would prefer to <i>not</i> be on stream right now, if thats ok. I mean."
I'm a VTuber as well, but my community is small and close. Big and small communities are completely different worlds. It would freeze me completely.
Besides, I stream mostly for fun while I push through college. Alot of my viewers are friends from there too! So, it's a fun way to share games together. 
Aoi is full time. It's her job. Or... is it to her? 
As we walk towards the train, I can hear happy little chew noises as she enjoys her food. The train upclose is much more advanced that I would expect. It's probably just for show. We are online, after all. 
Licking her fingers and squishing the wrapper, Aoi take the first step into the train.
Aoi::
"Watch your step and welcome to the Japan High Speed Rail! Really, you can sit anywhere. It's not like there's anyone to complain."
MC::
The car we walk into is business first class. Full tables with plush leather seats adorn the space, holo displays showing relevant information like weather, news, and stocks. On each table though, sits a vase with one lavendar lilly.
Clean and modern, with a slight sterile vibe. 
With the exception of the flowers and the crimson curtains that look like they were added on for a homey touch. 
"Um did you add the..."
Aoi cuts me off, smiling gently.
Aoi::
"The flowers and curtains are me. As an AI, I'm all about some efficiency. There's something about a touch of color that really brightens up a place, though."
MC::
A bit hesitant, I sit in the table section next to the exit. As I place my backpack in the seat next to me I watch her sit opposite of me. 
"How long is the trip to Twatch normally?"
She purses her lips, a finger touching her chin. 
Aoi::
"Not long at all. Less than 30 minutes normally. Distance is weird here."
MC::
That peaks my interest.
"Oh? What do you mean?"
She looks like she is trying to find the right words.
Aoi::
"Well... Some days, it's a five minute trip. Other days it can be an hour. The <i>average</i> time is around 20 minutes. If I had to guess? The locations move based on congestion."
"It's not very important. I mean, it could also just be lag from the internet connection as well. I'm not programmed with that information."
MC::
The population of server makes some sort of sense I guess. 
"What if perspective alters distance?" 
Oh, I didnt' mean to say that out loud. I blush a bit. 
I look up, only to find her studying me. 
Aoi::
You know you look kind of familiar to me. Have we met?"
MC::
There's no way she could recognize me. I'm an unknown. 
"No, but I've heard of you! I love your streams. Especially the random fact streams you sometimes set up."
She chuckles.
"I appreciate that you enjoy those! I spend more time than I should picking up random things from the internet. Even for me, it takes some time."
MC::
// (Audio: Train sounds)
With a slight 'whoosh', the train starts moving, but the speed quickly increases. In under a minute the scenery is blurring by. 
I'm finally on my way. Into the unknown. Again.
For the next 20 mins, we talk about new game releases, bugs in VR worlds, and the general annoyances of stream. Some things I had to keep my mouth shut. I don't know if she considers me just a program running through 'daily' tasks or not.
Either way, she's exactly the same person she is while streaming. 
The train suddenly slows down for just a second. I look outside the window at the countryside. A flash of white? For a second, nothing existed, not even the tracks. 
The scenery changes dramatically. A high tech city, beyond anything currently in the real world. The outskirts of one anyway. 
Leaning forward, I gaze at the lush green treetops, the flying cars, and the bright sky. 
I resist the urge to gasp. 
Aoi::
"Never traveled between Domains this way before huh? Won't deny: it's quite the experience."
MC::
The train is slowing down from its breakneck speed. 
"Is it normal to not have a driver? I haven't seen anyone else."
Aoi is typing on a holgraphic keyboard in front of the screen. Noticing my gaze, she looks up. 
Aoi::
"Oh! Yeah. I command it via this interface. It's really easy inside your own domain."
MC::
She chuckles.
Aoi::
"You think I can afford to hire a driver? Oh! Before you go..."
MC:: 
As the train slows down and enters a train station, Aoi shuts off her interface, reaching into the box on the table. 
Her delicate hand reaches in and pulls out a golden ticket with glowing text. The text is indecipherable, scrolling across the top. With one motion, she thrusts it into my hands. 
I feel the blush rise up. So close! I can smell a light scent of fruits. I look at the ticket to avoid her eyes. 
"What's this?"
Yes, change the subject! She was so close!
Aoi::
"This ticket is a ticket to my domain, the train and the stations I use. Meaning, you can summon this train, even if my systems are offline. So don't rush shopping, kay?"
MC::
The train comes to a stop and I stand up, studying the ticket. With a nonchalant hand, I shoulder my backpack.
Aoi is grabbing another item, this one a folded paper. 
Aoi::
"This is a map of the Twatch Server. 
MC::
She pauses, pursing her lips. 
Aoi::
"If you currently don't have a phone or smart device, I would recommend you getting one. There's a store..hmmm... here. "
MC::
She moves closer to me with the open map, pointing to a location a few kilometers from the train station.
So wholesome and kawaii!
"Thank you so much for everything, Aoi!"
Am I blushing? My ears feel hot. 
She smiles, disarmingly warm.
Aoi::
"No Problem! If this <i>is</i> your first time here, just be aware. It can be confusing. But... I have to get going. I have to stream soon. See you later, kay?"
"Um..."
MC::
Oh. My name.
"MC. It's been a fun ride, Aoi."
Her smile is sooo cute!
Aoi::
"Have a good day!"
// (Audio: Door closes Train starts moving)
MC::
The door closes behind, and my gaping mouth betrays my shock as I see the station for the first time. 
It doesn't even look like any station I've ever experienced. 
The railway shoots through a large, open air platform, surrounded by a <i>massive</i> food court. 
"This is going to be a very strange day."
