MC::
I have a nagging feeling this place doesn't have any food. 
I look outside. What lies beyond that wall? 
//(Audio: Rustle of fabric)
I move to the closet, opening it slowly. There has to be some normal, less formal clothes in here. The walk in closet is <i>full</i> of japanese kimonos. 
As an anime character, my eyes would be shining stars! I guess I can have it that way. 
I chuckle at myself, scanning the purple, pinks, reds, and speckled browns, running my hands along the silken sleeves. 
Focus! Food, the hunt for life. 
Thankfully, the other side of this closet has the urban clothes: casual shirts, tennis shoes, jeans, skirts, and shorts. Feeling the urgency, I grab what is closest. 
//(Audio: Steps start)
Happy with my choice, I dress and head outside, thumbing on the wooden platform sandles. 
What did I pick? A simple grey t-shirt with the red silhouette  of a mask inked on it. The jeans are capri style. Both are warm enough for the chill gathering in the air. 
I didn't forget my wallet. It's in my left hand. 
// (Audio Steps stop)
I stop right outside the gate. If this is a closed server, I will be fine. If not...Well the mechanics of the internet is unknown for someone like me. 
"You got this!"
I nod to myself, and open the door. 
The wind picks up as I pull the latch and open the gate door. Peering through the open crack, I assess my situation.
A road: snaking north to south. Directly in front of me lies the start of thick foliage and trees. So much, in fact, I can't see far into the vegetation. This complex sits in the forest. 
I step out, closing the door, locking it with the proper key. South looks to be heading deeper into the forest. Uphill to boot!
No thanks, I could eat a horse right now. 
North though. It meanders downhill and seems to curve around the hill my house is standing on. 
<i>My</i> manor. How do I know it is? It's odd that I feel that way already. 
File it away for later. This is low key awesome though! In retrospecdt, I've always wanted to live in a place like this. It's lush, quiet, and far enough away from the bustling city for me. 
I wish my parents were here to share this though. 
//(Audio: Feet on gravel)
My feet start moving of their own accord, driven by hunger. A mile, if there is no change, I will turn back and try to find the kitchen.
The crunch of rock under my sandles is loud in the surrounding quiet. The sun's light barely warms the air. Is it early spring? Or late fall? 
I couldn't get access to the server's chat system. No access to the gateway. It <i>just</i> didn't exist! Yet, I have some form of connection. 
Shibi gave me the address and password. I have <i>some</i> doubt. Perhaps I got the address wrong? 
No way. I know it like my home address. It was drilled over and over. There was not other way to establish communication with Digital Horizons. It <i>is</i> my lifeline, after all. 
The path downhill seems steeper here. 
"Going to be fun climbing back up." , I mumble, the crunch of rock loud in my ears. 
No way I misremembered the address. I can tell already some of this place is from my own perspective. The details though. It's simply too much for my mind to comprehend... Unless, we dramatically underestimated the mind's ability to adapt.
If that's not it, the only other conclusion is scary, and I don't want to think about it now.
I'm not on the server. 
So much can go wrong down that path. My parents are planning on babying me after the test. I was going to live stream afterwards to let my fans know I'm ok. As a VTuber myself, the implications of this new technology opens up so many possibilities.
//(Audio: Laughter from MC)
I put my hand to my mouth. The laugh shocks me. It's genuine and full of mirth. 
"Way to get me off the internet Mom!"
Here I am, walking in the 'Real World' and getting plenty of sunshine. I'm even hiking. Wait let me...
//Audio: Walking stops.
I touch some grass on the side of the road.
"Touched some grass MOM!", I yell at the sky.
// Audio: Walking on gravel
The bend if flattening. The forest is thinning. I come around this last bend and...
Below me is a valley with a large town nestling between two hills. Even from here, I can observe cars moving. Surrounding the city are what seems to be rice fields. 
I stare silently, wiping sweat from my brow. The town screams japanese, based on my former experience in Okinawa.
"Where am I?"
I ask the air, but it does not reply.
