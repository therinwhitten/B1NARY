// Audio: Birds Chirping and light wind.
MC::
"Well, I made it."
Sitting on a bench at 7 am, nursing a hot coffee, I wait on Aoi's train to show up around the corner. 
I woke up in a bad state this morning. 
Sure, kotatsus are comfy, but your back pays for it. 
Lot's of slobber too. 
// Audio: Sipping 
I look up from the top of my can of coffee, to glance at the leather backpack next to me. 
Funny. I found more than four styles of backpacks in the back of the closet. 
Today's choice was simple. Blue jeans, a brown turtleneck, and some normal tennis shoes. 
I put my hair in a ponytail as well. Nice and simple. 
The storm passed over last night. It left signs though. 
Some trees are down, including a slew of branches on the streets from the fierce winds. 
I was slower getting down here because of it. Dodging large water puddles like land mines. 
The air though: so crisp and nice. Clean. I can forgive it this time. 
I'm in adult mode this morning, prepared for what's to come as much as I humanly can be. 
It's day two with no contact. I don't even know if time works the same way here. 
"Shibi, hang in there."
I hope to find some information in the twatch server today. 
Aoi mentioned something about getting some form of smartphone today? I wonder...
If one here could let me send info to Shibi... It's worth a shot. 
Get one with gps, texting, music, and internet all wrapped into one. 
It's like living in a glass box. I can see everything. Yet, trying to interact is like hitting a wall. It's annoying, and scary. 
I can't help but feel I'm preparing to buckle down and stay in the long term. Like I'm moving to a new house. 
It wouldn't be <i>bad</i> really. Digital Horizons might have an issue. 
I look down the tracks. 
// Audio: Feet tapping in patiently.
The schedule said around 715. I guess she will want to grab her sandwich too. 
I guess I owe thanks to her love of pork cutlet sandwiches for even being able to meet her? 
// Audio: Laughs
Speaking of...
The train station is dead again today. Literally not one person man's the station at all. 
// Audio: Train Whistle off in the distance.
There it is!
I stand up, shouldering my backpack quickly. The moment the whistle ends, I see the train come barreling around the bend at over 100km/h easily. 
Other than the sounds of the tracks, you can't hear anything from the train itself. 
Nervousness jumps into my throat and I stomp it back down. 
"You talked to her yesterday. What are you scared of?"
I can't pin point the issue. Aoi acts like her live stream counterpart, surely. 
That's what bothers me. How <i>many</i> Aoi are there? Or are the copies connected? 
// Audio: Train Brakes
I shake my head. 
The main engine rolls by me, with no driver, as it passes me. 
The silvers and blues of the Japan Speed Rail Company glitter as the morning sun catches the angles just right. 
As the train comes to a complete stop, I wait about 30 seconds. 
Sure enough, the first car right behind the engine has the rear door open. Aoi, garbed in the same uniform she wore yesterday steps out, focused on one thing.
When she spies me, her face brightens up dramatically. She stops instantly, smiling warmly to me. 
Aoi::
"You made it! Excellent!"
MC::
Her face takes on a mock sterness. 
Aoi::
"You have your ticket madam?"
MC::
She starts walking towards me, gently but determined. 
"Yes, right here."
I raise my ticket, the display item with my location tagged on it. 
At sighting the ticket, she smiles even more. 
Aoi::
"You remembered! Here let me scan it."
MC:: 
Miyuki aims her left pinky, point first, at the corner of the ticket. 
The ticket beeps and changes to accepted in bright red letters near the edge. 
Satsified, she turns to look at the vending machines. 
She coughs politely and looks gravely at me. 
Aoi::
"I've a mission, should you choose to accept it traveler. Collect (1) Niman Cutlet and bring it to me. Will you accept?"
MC::
I need more coffee anyway. 
I return the mock seriousness. 
"I accept the mission. Would you like something to drink?"
She frowns a touch, her dainty hand going to her chin. 
Aoi::
"Nah, I made fresh coffee. Even made a bit more than normal just in case you shown up today, as well."
MC::
She looks at me gratefully. 
Aoi::
"The happiness of my stomach is in your hands then."
MC::
Yes the pork cutlet sandwich she loves. Very well. 
I have two sandwiches and a few drinks for the shopping today already in my bag. 
Free coffee I'm on board for. 
// Audio: Walking to vending machine and putting coins in. Falling of items.
I grab two, one for me as well. 
I pause.
"Wait, who actually fills up the machine..."
As I grab the second one, I scan the area a bit, pivoting to walk to the train. 
Miyuki is adjusting her dress as she watches me. 
Aoi::
"Something wrong?"
MC::
I shrug.
"I haven't seen anyone here at all. Let alone a person that comes to fill the vending machines."
She laughs lightly.
Aoi::
"You are thinking like it's the real world too much. It just respawns each night; at least in some areas."
"Hmmm. This area is a more public domain, so they may have vending machine workers. Chances are they just refill each night."
MC::
Filing that away for later. More Public domain? What does that even mean? 
Both sandwiches in hand, I trot over to Aoi and the open door. I hand her her share. 
Aoi::
"Oh you want to try one too? Heh Heh Heh. Don't say I didn't warn you. They are addicting."
MC::
// Audio: door Close
As we both climb into the train car, the door closes behind us. 
Before we even sit down, she asks.
Aoi::
"Where is your paper map?"
MC::
I wince.
"I... Um washed it by accident?" 
Chuckling she pulls out another map from the box. 
With a mock stern look...
Aoi::
"I can't keep giving these out, you know. They cost money to make."
"So be sure to get a phone or something with GPS while you are at Twatch ok?"
MC::
I tell her with my eyes.
"I will Aoi. Thank you for all of your support!"
Seemingly satisfied, she nodded approvingly. She pours dark, rich coffee into two fine china cups, sliding mine over.
Aoi::
"Would  you like sugar or cream?"
MC::
{choice: What do I want in my coffee?}
{
    Sugar
    [
        "Sugar please! Thank you."
    ]
    Sugar and cream.
    [
        "Both please! Load them up!"
    ]
    Black, like my soul.
    [
        "I like it raw. Thanks."
    ]
    Oh Cream only.
    [
        "Just some cream, thanks."
    ]
}
Without complaint, she adjusts my coffee for me.
//Audio: moving of china.
Aoi::
"Sometimes I like the flavor of coffee in the morning. Lot's to do for me today."
MC::
"Oh yeah? Anything you can talk about?"
I'm genuinely curious. She is working behind the scenes here. No one really sees her when she is not streaming, or working in the trains in the real world.
Politely she shoots me down.
Aoi::
"Sorry but can't talk about it yet. I hardly know you. Don't worry though. It's a personal 'quest' of mine."
MC::
I take a sip, the dark roast really clean. It's good stuff. 
Aoi::
"What about you? I know you want to get a phone, but what's your plan for shopping?"
MC::
// Audio: Train squeaks. Digital button presses.
As she speaks, she opens up a small floating panel in front of her. After pressing a few buttons, the train starts moving.
You can barely feel the shift, but it's there. 
Being honest..."I haven't thought that far ahead yet. I won't know until I go walking around."
"How long will it take to get there?"
She frowns in thought for a second.
Aoi::
"Some days it's only 5 mins, but can take as long as an hour at this time of day."
MC::
Noticing my confusion painting itself on my face, she quickly replies.
Aoi::
"Distance depends on server population. So if there are oodles of people there, the domain is bigger. You don't do alot of full dive VR do you?"
MC::
"If I had the money for the full dive, I would totally be all over it. It's still a bit cost prohibitive."
I answer sheepishly.
Yeah the cost is insane. It's at the very edge of tech right now. Certain anime have caused a ton of concern over them. I don't think I need to name them. 
So the full dive system costs much more to give customer's peice of mind. Lot's of fail safes. 
Chewing on her own sandwich, she studies me.
Around the meat, she says.
Aoi::
"It's ok. You're here now. I assumed you were though. Maybe a desktop client?"
MC::
The last sentence was quiet, as if thinking to herself. 
Oh.
OH!
I look like I'm in a full dive?
Sure let's go with that.
"You guessed right. I'm a streamer, after all. Have all the tracking gear at home."
She nods, acceptingly. 
Aoi::
"Very well! Just in case, I will add my schedule to your ticket. You don't do well with paper items..."
MC::
She giggles a bit, opening another panel in the air, and swiping the information towards me. I feel the ticket vibrate in my pocket.
Aoi::
"MC, just be sure to be back around 5pm. I will come back and bring you back if you choose."
MC::
The change of scenery from the corner of my eye causes me to startle. Suddenly, what was once rolling, forested hills, turns into a solid white...'nothing.' 
In a few seconds, we fly into a more sci fi style forest. 
Poles for power are flying by, but I don't see any cables between them. The color of the sky is slightly different too. Odd. 
I take another sip of coffee and lean forward. 
"Woahh."
Aoi::
"I love seeing people's first reactions to the shift. You get used to it. We just entered the twatch server domain."
MC::
As I focus, I realize how fast we were actually moving. Easily over 300kph. The train lurches a bit, slowing down. 
"This is incredible!"
I'm finding it harder to stay focused on my goal. It feels more and more like a vacation each minute that passes by. 
"Which domain did we leave though?"
Aoi looks at me carefully.
Aoi::
"It's a general world domain. However, there's always a few player domains attached. You should know where your 'home' is. Just in case I miss you though..."
MC::
She considers her words. 
Aoi::
"Iseskai Domain 12. That is the domain you came from."
MC::
I jolt.
"And the storm?"
Aoi::
"That storm went across all of the Isesaki domains last night. Think of instancing with servers."
MC::
This is... simply more than I could have ever imagined. The servers are already designed with full dive in mind. Which makes my mission extremely easy. 
The Japan Speed Rail slows down and comes to a stop inside an open air station. 
The station screams near future, almost cyber punk with food stalls everywhere, and "people" everywhere!
"So... erm here?"
Aoi nods. 
Aoi::
"Yep, this is your stop! Remember..."
MC::
She stares at me, willing me to lock this information away.
Aoi::
"5PM. Don't miss me. It's my last trip of the day. If you do. As new as you are... I recommend staying in one of the hotels here instead of trying to find another way."
MC::
I nod.
"No buses?"
For a split second, there resides concern in her pale eyes.
Aoi::
"Not every mode of transportation is what it seems here. Be careful. I don't want to scare you, but the danger is there."
MC::
I nod seriously.
Red flag? 
"Got it. I'll be very careful."
I stand up, drinking the last bit of coffee in one gulp, and grab my backpack.
I mean this with all of my heart. I bow in a 90 degree angle.
"Thank you so much."
I can hear an intake of breath. 
Aoi::
"You're very welcome, MC. Thank you for giving me some company."
MC::
Her voice is emotionally warm. Very warm. I stand back up.
I take one last look at her. She is back to her normal self. Did I sense something else there for a second?
I nod to myself. And turn to go. 
// Audio: Door Open
As I step outside, the door closes behind me, and the train lurches forward again.
Aoi is waving at the window. I wave back, returning the gesture. 
I look around at what appears to be at least 100 'people' moving about, buying stuff for breakfast. I sigh. 
"A whole new world huh?"
And with that, I take my first step...
