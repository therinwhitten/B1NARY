//(Audio: Walking)
MC::
Below me, is a valley, with a large town that nestles between two hills. Even from here, I can see a few cars moving.  Surrounding the city, sprawls rice fields and small one family farms. 
// (Audio: Stops walking)
Stopping to catch my breath, I stare silently, wiping beading sweat from my brow. The town looks Japanese. I did spend two weeks in Okinawa.
Train tracks meander through the small valley, threading their way through to all meet at a station at the bottom of this hill. From this vantage point, I don't see any traffic to it. 
Beyond the train station, I can see streets snaking into town. A bit further to go. 
// (Audio: walking.)
It's a win win! Train stations normally have a <i>ton</i> of vending machines!
I know it's not the best choice... It's the easiest though. Worse case, I have to walk further into town and look for a store. 
I'm almost jogging down the remainder of the hill, scanning for people. No one's at the train station. There is <i>no</i> sign of life. No trains, conductors, or staff.
Most importantly, no security...
To be fair though, there's normally little security at the outlying train stops I have traveled through.
As I get closer, I see them, confirming my own location. I spy with my eye a full <i>line</i> of vending machines!
// (Audio: walking to a stop, birds chirping and light wind)
At the channel gate, I pause, looking around inside as much I possibly can.  
No sign of life anywhere. 
Slowly and quietly, I climb over the security bars, scanning for guards or cameras. 
I wouldn't do this in the real world. The imminent threat of jail time would freeze me in my tracks. 
On the other side, I wait, listening carefully.
It feels a bit eerie now, being so empty. No people, nor any dogs and cats. Nothing. 
So birds, and the faint sound of refrigeration from the vending machines. Other than that...
"Let's get the loot." , I whisper.
The row of vending machines are right near one of the platforms. I slowly make my way, scanning with a slight feeling of paranoia.
I'm not stealing anything. I am going to buy everything.
"Jeez MC. No one's here to arrest you."
Worse, what if they tie me up! What if I enjoy it?!
I shake my head. Let's just get the food. 
Already wallet in hand, I stand brazenly in front of the row of machines. Tuna, hamburger steak, mankatsu, niman cutlet. If there was indication that this place is patterned after Japan, this would be the proof. 
I pause in deliberation. So many tasty choices! I should just get a few. They don't hold as well as grocery store food. I'm still a bit hungry though. 
A <i>normal</i> level level of hungry: not that bone knawing death appetite I had earlier. 
All of it looks good! HMMM. 
// (Audio: Vending machine sounds)
I grab a few niman cutlets, some hamburger steaks, and a few bags of corn chips. As I go down the line, I find some green tea, canned coffee (mocha), and a few boxes salads. 
I might as well still try for a balanced diet as much as possible. Just in case. 
// (Audio: Zipper)
Closing my backpack, I shoulder it back on. 
//(Audio: Open Canned Cofffee and "ah")
So yummy!
I peek over the edge to look at the state of the track curiously. They look well used. No signs of neglect.
It's empty, sure. It's clean though, like it's maintained regularly. There are only a few tracks heading north and south. There is what looks like a main building. 
Trains do seem to stop here on a regular basis. 
During my nap, I swear I heard a train whistle. Maybe that was the train stopping here?  If I could find a possible schedule somewhere? Where was that bulletin board? 
I start walking, scanning the plexiglass enclosures for any paperwork. Surely they have a schedule up.
// (Audio: walking slowly)
There we go! That one. 
"Come to momma!"
One of the platforms a few meters away from the vending machines looks to be the most used. 
Some of these are pretty funny.
A guy lost his Dakimakura a few days back. Reward of 10k Yen for it's return. Some much for thinking it was <i>just</i> an American stereotype.
That's not a bad reward...
"Hang on dude. I got you. Stay strong."
One thing I should note here: I'm not fluent in Japanese. I know a bit but... I'm reading these like they are written in my native language.
There it is, the official train schedule. Well that's what I would say if it wasn't written in crayon with happy faces all over it? 
Morning stops at 7am. That's early!
"Sigh"
"Twatch Run?"
Thinking I misread the kanji, I scan the text again. Yes. Twatch? My heart skips a beat.
//(Audio: heartbeat)
This is either a joke my own mind is playing on me, or I just am just confirming my current suspicions. This is not a closed server. 
"I'm ONLINE."
And I'm somewhere outside of the twatch servers?  Where am I then? 
//(Audio: Deep breaths)
I know that scribble. 
It's Aoi Miyuki's crayola chaos. 
A train station and Aoi? It can't be her right? 
If so, that would be freaking awesome!
MC::
I sit down on the nearest bench.
Or am I still asleep and dreaming?
"Oh. My. God. What do I do?!"
I feel the heat rise my cheeks as I quickly hide behind my coffee can. I look around. No one is here. 
Shibi knows I am not in the right place by now. Telling outsiders could be dangerous, for the company, and for me. 
How do I confirm though? Unless I meet them? 
If this 'Aoi' is the real one, it could be a way to get a hold of Shibi...
And exactly how would I go about that? 
"Hey Aoi! Hi. I'm a <i>huge</i> fan of yours. I love your streams! I don't know if you know this, but I'm a real person in the internet. Can you send this cryptic message to a random email please?"
I moan pathetically. It does. It does sound as ludicrus as I thought it would. 
Baka, stalker, crazy! And worse? She may think I'm just an AI running a program...
"ARGH"
Tears well up. What do I do?!
Palming my head, I try <i>not</i> to cry in pure frustration. 
How?
I lean on my knees. No sounds, with the exception of the faint chirp of birds in the distance, the crisp air rustling leaves. 
// (Audio: Slurping)
This coffee is so good. 
"I should probably keep what I am a secret." , I inform the birds."
Yes. I shouldn't say anything about my situation to <i>anyone</i>, maybe even pretend to be an AI, just in case Aoi is the real deal. At least, until I can gain some trust from her.
Well, I do know <i>when</i> she will be here. I just have to show up early right? Maybe try to get a ride to twatch? There would be more opportunities to communicate there. 
<i>Wait Wait Wait. What are you doing? You have a job to do. Why would you compound the issue by going to the Twatch Server?</i>
"I'm curious." What's it like? To meet all of the streamers in person while inside the server? What does it look like? Do they have homes, stores, and places to have fun? 
Do programs have homes they live in? Do they cook now? 
//(Audio: Wind gust.)
Fear is trying to rear it's ugly head, and the breeze almost seems like it reacts to it. A sudden gale of cold wind hits me, causing me to shiver across my whole body. 
So many unknowns, and I've yet to try and reach out to Shibi yet.
The sun is hinting at setting soon. I have my loot, and a plan for tommorow. Let's get home. 
It's all I have for now. 
Standing up, my eyes drift to the town beyond the train station. Maybe later. 
It does look lively from here. I did avoid it because there might actually be people in VR roaming about. I'm a bit shy when it comes to larger crowds. At least with Twatch, there are channels and ways to hide.
Another gust of wind and I see it coming over the hills: a wall of dark clouds coming in <i>fast</i>.
"Time to go." I say to myself, stifling another shiver. 
Adjusting my backpack of yummies, I walk towards the exit. 
Like I even need to worry. No one's here.
