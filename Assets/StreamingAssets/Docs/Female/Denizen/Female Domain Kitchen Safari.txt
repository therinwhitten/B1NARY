So if this place has common sense, the kitchen should be in this complex. 
Hopefully it will have some form of food to munch on. 
Right now? I have to remain calm. There are no instructions, no clear path. It's already nerve-wracking. 
No one really knows anything about this process. What or where I'm at is a debate at this point. 
The kitchen <i>has</i> to have food! Has to!
I scan the bedroom, noticing immediately that there only seems to be a closet. I don't see any doors leading deeper into the interior.
So, it's a traditional Japanese manor, with only access from the outside. And, the room tickles my memory. 
Should I know this place? 
This <i>could</i> be fun. Food first! Let's see if we can find the kitchen...
ONWARD!
// (Audio: Barefoot walking)
The tatami mats hold a light chill on my feet as I step out of the bedroom. It looks like the master bedroom is set in the far north corner of the complex. 
I look to the south, noticing several doors, and what seems to be another, smaller inner courtyard? 
The air is pretty chilly, and I'm currently regretting not trying to find some socks. I would, but my growling stomach is urging me to push forward. 
I come up to the next door. 
//(Audio: Sigh and walking stops.)
I grab the handle to the sliding door. Very slowly and as quiet as I can, I open it. 
//(Audio: sliding dooor sound)
It's an armory?
Peeking my head in, I blink and look again. Two suits of traditional samurai armor are the centerpeice of the room, set up on female mannequins. Crystal display cases on pedastals stand along the outer wall, containing various types of oriental weapons.
Even a bow is set on it's own rack with a back of arrows next to it. 
It <i>is</i> a place I could spend quite some time in, no food though. I close the door. 
// (Audio: Sliding Door and walking)
There are two more rooms before I make it to the inner sanctum. I check them one by one. Both were what looks like guest bedrooms, with simple furnishings, a cot on the floor, and a nightstand. 
<i>Keep. Moving.</i>
// (Audio: Walking and the sounds of the bamboo fountain)
The inner sanctum is beautiful!
In the very center, lies a small fish pond with a bamboo fountain tapping away. 
//(Whistles)
I whistle appreciatively as I walk by. The light bubbling of water, with the sudden bop, soothes my nerves. On the other side is another pathway with multiple doors. 
I wish, <i>wish</i> , I could just stop and lose myself near the fountain, if it wasn't for the hunger that is currently gnawing at my spine.
So the doors. 
// (Audio: sliding open doors.)
First one is a larger, family-style dressing room, with drawers for holding clothing. 
I take a few steps in and notice warm steam coming from deeper inside. This must be the complex bath! Nice and cozy!
// (Audio: sliding open doors.)
The next door is thankfully a living room, complete with a large flatscreen TV, and an open kitchen. 
YES!
// (Audio: sliding open doors. Walking Stops)
I walk in and close to door to shelter myself the chill outside. 
Behind the cooking island, is the large, stainless steel fridge, and my goal! Without ceremony, I march right up, hoping against hope, that there will be something to eat in there. 
//(Audio: Opening of Kitchen door)
// (Audio: Clapping)
Clapping in glee, I discover a half gallon of milk, and three takeout boxes. 
My hunger steps aside for a second. The boxes look very familiar...
My last meal before I left for the Lab was crab ragoon, and some udon from some little take out booth on the way. And the other half I brought home with me? 
It's sitting in the fridge.
"No fucking way."
It comes out tired, and the tone is even slighly different. My lungs and the size of my body is different. Interesting.
<i>Food.</i>
I yoink the food greedily and place the boxes on the cooking island, searching several drawers for utencils I might use. <i>If there are none, I'm about to devour this food like a cave woman.</i>
Found the silverware!
I hesitate with one box in hand, and a clean fork in the other, as small part of my brain mulling this over. If I did listen at this time, it would point out this is residual perspective, and it's way more complete than the classes suggested.
Not right now though, that voice is silent and slobbering over the food in front of me.
(Audio: chewing sounds)
I don't wait, and a soggy, cold, crab ragoon appears like magic on my fork. It goes into my mouth, the flavor exploding and filling my life with color. 
Well the flavor of cold cardboard. Its soggy, stale, and not very satifying... No crunch is left sadly.
To my body, it's gourmet steak with a bowl of fresh and piping hot ramen. My body is out of fricks to give. So? I grab another peice and shovel it down.
It takes a minute or two, but I manage to scarf down the entire take out box. 
(Audio: Gulp sounds)
Not even caring, I drink straight from the carton. Take that Mom!
Fresh, crisp and full of nom nom.
//(Audio: Burp sounds)
The gnawing feeling is receding quickly. I wipe the excess milk from my lips, smiling with contentment. 
I take in the rest of the room. 
The floor is worn here, the mats themselves seeing years and years of use. Instead of a normal dinner table, an overgrown Kotatsu is the focus of the living space. The red and black blankets look fluffy and very warm!
On the floor around the table, sit large pillows, the sheaths aged like a fine wine. The cozy space is perfect for welcoming close family and watching tv. 
How can it feel so inviting? I feel generations of family have enjoyed this room. 
Generations...
Do I... know this place? 
This isn't real! It feels so... Warm. Familiar. 
I can imagine my grandma and grandpa sitting at the Kotatsu watching TV, with my mother making dinner. It almost feels like a memory of my own has created this room.
//(Audio: Sniffing)
I tear up. Wiping my tears away, I sniff. I haven't seen my grandparents in years. 
I sit down, tucking my legs under the kotatsu. I lean back, putting the milk carton on the polished surface of the table next to the remote. 
//(Audio: Milk carton on  the table)
I lean back on the pillows, sighing. 
The blank TV stares back at me. So much to worry about right now. With my belly full. I can feel pent up anxiety melt into the warmth. 
Maybe I can relax a bit. I think I <i>need</i> to ease back a bit. Pins and needles since I opened my eyes. It's wearing on me. 
This was my grandparent's home, <i>my home</i> at one time, when I was very young. I remember now. 
My place. 
My home. 
And it has always been. 
//(Audio: VA Sob)
Even my brain is a bit cruel to me. Or, maybe I need to see this? 
I pick up the remote and hit the button.
//(Audio: CLick)
//(Audio: Music Videos)
Some old music videos from my childhood pop up. I recognize the artist instantly.
The smile brightens my face. 
Yes. I know this TV is not connected to any TV Networks or stations. These songs are directly from my memory. This whole place is. 
I know something is very wrong. 
And a small part of me is afraid.
Right now though? I lay, soaking up the warmth under the kotatsu, lost in my own thoughts, remembering old days with my family. I have so many memories here. 
Fishing out in the woods, taking hikes up in the mountains around here to collect pond lillies. 
I feel myself drift a bit. It's getting harder to think...
//(Tranistion: Eyeblink and then close)
//(Audio: Train Whistles)
MC::
??
//(Audio: moans tiredly)
"No mom! I don't want to get up yet! Five more minutes?"
//(Audio: Second Train whistle)
"Huh?!"
<i>Oh. My. God. I fell asleep?!</i>
//(Audio: Static from the TV)
//(Transition: Eyeblink open and close, then open)
How long? 
Stifling a yawn, I glance at my watch. 
Two hours? Yeah two hours. 
The emotional stress I felt before is but a distant and foggy dream. I <i>do</i> feel a bit better. I needed that nap more than I thought. 
//(Audio: VA Yawn loud)
I shouldn't have fallen asleep. 
I still have time to gather some more food. The takeout won't last long. Well, if there is a store here. 
I haven't even checked outside yet. Should I go explore then?  And yeah I feel pretty nasty in my clothes. 
"I don't wanna!"
I speak to the room, loud and whiny.
Slowly, I drag my legs out from under the kotatsu. 
Grabbing the milk carton, I go to deposit it into the trash. 
And with that. I'm out!
//(Audio: Open door and walk out.)
The sun's light has no bite, even though it's mid afternoon. No clouds mar the clear blue of the sky.
I've mixed feelings about this place. It's a carbon copy of a place I lived in my past. This is almost a 100 percent accurate projection of that memory. 
I need food. Then, I need to establish communication with Shibi. If that doesn't work, then I need to know <i>why</i>. Step by step. No imminent danger seems to present itself. 
//(Audio: MC Laughing)
I laugh wryly. 
Here I am, in a huge manor, with power, food, and water, and I consider this 'surival'. 
Maybe I should start rubbing some sticks together in the courtyard for a fire. 
//(Audio: Walking)
My jaunt takes me back to the bedroom where I woke up the first time. There was a full room closet there. Get changed and go out of the complex. Clueless is not a good state to be in...
Is there even an outside? What is beyond those walls? Maybe a town? 
Let's hope, because I don't have a ton of food. 
//Audio: Opening of doors
With a dramatic motion, I fling open the doors of the closet. 
If I was an anime character, my eyes would be stars. Well I mean, I can here. 
I chuckle at myself, scanning the rows of purple, pinks, reds, and speckled browns, running my hands along the sliken sleeves. So many cuts and types!
<i>Focus. You need food!</i>
I shake my head. 
Thankfully the in the back of the closet is the urban collection for hiking and camping. Casual shirts, shoes, jeans, skirts and shorts.  Feeling a bit of urgency. I grab the closest clothes that seem to match. 
Ah yeah! A backpack. Good job me! Black and red leather. I snatch it up for grabbing supplies. 
//Audio: Walking
I don't feel so weird now. Fully clothed and ready for exploration! I put the platform wooden sandles on and head to the main gate. 
I happen to choose some good clothes that are warm enough: but light: simple grey shirt, with a set of capri jeans. 
Wallet is here too. I wouldn't forget that. Keys are attached to it just like at home. 
As I open the large gate door, the wind picks up. I crack it open carefully, hoping something was actually outside. 
A road snaking north to south. On the other side lies thick foliage and large trees. So much, in fact, I can't see beyond. This manor is sitting inside a forest.
"Well that eases the mind a bit."
I <i>was</i> expecting nothing but white outside, just like an unfinished video game. I am very happy I was wrong.
//(Audio: gate close and key lock)
So, I step out and close the gate, locking it with the keys. South looks to be heading deeper into the forest and shows little signs of food retrieval, unless I plan to go hunting.
North looks like it goes downhill, curving around a hilltop. 
This manor feels like home already. And that doesn't bother me...
File it away for later. This is low-key awesome though! In retrospect, I've always wanted to livein a place kind of like this! It's lush, quiet, and away from the bustle of a city.
I wish my family was here to share this experience with me. I've always ran to my family for support when I needed it.  It's not a bad thing to lean on others, you know!
Some in this world has never had that luxury. So, I count my blessings and embrace the warmth.
//(Audio: Walking: faster)
I start my journey. No hunger to drive me to do stupid things, and I enjoy the view! The crunch of rock under my sandals is loud against the silence. It's still feeling very cool, almost like the sun of an early spring or fall. 
No access to the server's messaging system. No access to even the gateway. It simply didn't exist. Yet, the TV worked just fine? 
I ponder this.
Shibi made me memorize the address and password, so I know for a fact I got those right. 
There is simply no way I got that wrong. 
The path downhill looks a bit steep. 
It's going to be a bit uncomfortable walking back up...
I wonder. How <i>do</i> muscles work here?  Should I just expect myself to be strong, and my mind will make it so? Or, perhaps, will my brain force reality on me? How much of my conscious mind is in control of the environment?
I didn't get it wrong. Four days, blank server, testing memory, pattern degradation (if it exists), and mental fatigue long-term. This test was simply a toe dip into the pond of possibilities. Testing the waters, if you will. 
The bend of the road is quickly approaching. 
This server is not barren at all. I <i>can</i> tell some of this place is directly from my memories. The details though. Things are detailed in ways that my weak mind has no way of knowing. Or, I am drastically underestimating the power of the mind's ability to adapt. 
If not that, the only other conclusion is scary, and I don't want to think about it. 
I'm not on the test server.
I withdraw instantly. The knee jerk reaction. So much can go wrong going down that path. My parents were already planning a small trip to spoil me after the test. I was even planning on a live stream right after I got back. 
As a VTuber myself, the implications of the technology opens up so many amazing possibilities. I want to share. 
//Audio: MC laughing.
The laugh shocks me. 
"Way to get me off the internet <i>Mother</i>!"
Here I am, walking in the 'real world' and bathing in the sunlight, getting my vitamin D. 
Touching Grass. 
The irony of the situation doesn't slip past me. 
I stop focusing on the crunch of my feet and the ruminations of my slightly panicking mind. The bend is flattening, and the forest is thinning out. I come around the corner and...
