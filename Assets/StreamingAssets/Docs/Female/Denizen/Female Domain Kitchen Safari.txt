So if this place has common sense, the kitchen should be in this complex. 
Hopefully it will have some form of food to munch on. 
Right now? I have to remain calm. There are no instructions, no clear path. It's already nerve-wracking. 
No one really knows anything about this process. What or where I'm at is a debate at this point. 
The kitchen <i>has</i> to have food! Has to!
I scan the bedroom, noticing immediately that there only seems to be a closet. I don't see any doors leading deeper into the interior.
So, it's a traditional Japanese manor, with only access from the outside. And, the room tickles my memory. 
Should I know this place? 
This <i>could</i> be fun. Food first! Let's see if we can find the kitchen...
ONWARD!
// (Audio: Barefoot walking)
The tatami mats hold a light chill on my feet as I step out of the bedroom. It looks like the master bedroom is set in the far north corner of the complex. 
I look to the south, noticing several doors, and what seems to be another, smaller inner courtyard? 
The air is pretty chilly, and I'm currently regretting not trying to find some socks. I would, but my growling stomach is urging me to push forward. 
I come up to the next door. 
//(Audio: Sigh and walking stops.)
I grab the handle to the sliding door. Very slowly and as quiet as I can, I open it. 
//(Audio: sliding dooor sound)
It's an armory?
Peeking my head in, I blink and look again. Two suits of traditional samurai armor are the centerpeice of the room, set up on female mannequins. Crystal display cases on pedastals stand along the outer wall, containing various types of oriental weapons.
Even a bow is set on it's own rack with a back of arrows next to it. 
It <i>is</i> a place I could spend quite some time in, no food though. I close the door. 
// (Audio: Sliding Door and walking)
There are two more rooms before I make it to the inner sanctum. I check them one by one. Both were what looks like guest bedrooms, with simple furnishings, a cot on the floor, and a nightstand. 
<i>Keep. Moving.</i>
// (Audio: Walking and the sounds of the bamboo fountain)
The inner sanctum is beautiful!
In the very center, lies a small fish pond with a bamboo fountain tapping away. 
//(Whistles)
I whistle appreciatively as I walk by. The light bubbling of water, with the sudden bop, soothes my nerves. On the other side is another pathway with multiple doors. 
I wish, <i>wish</i> , I could just stop and lose myself near the fountain, if it wasn't for the hunger that is currently gnawing at my spine.
So the doors. 
// (Audio: sliding open doors.)
First one is a larger, family-style dressing room, with drawers for holding clothing. 
I take a few steps in and notice warm steam coming from deeper inside. This must be the complex bath! Nice and cozy!
// (Audio: sliding open doors.)
The next door is thankfully a living room, complete with a large flatscreen TV, and an open kitchen. 
YES!
// (Audio: sliding open doors. Walking Stops)
I walk in and close to door to shelter myself the chill outside. 
Behind the cooking island, is the large, stainless steel fridge, and my goal! Without ceremony, I march right up, hoping against hope, that there will be something to eat in there. 
//(Audio: Opening of Kitchen door)
// (Audio: Clapping)
Clapping in glee, I discover a half gallon of milk, and three takeout boxes. 
My hunger steps aside for a second. The boxes look very familiar...
My last meal before I left for the Lab was crab ragoon, and some udon from some little take out booth on the way. And the other half I brought home with me? 
It's sitting in the fridge.
"No fucking way."
It comes out tired, and the tone is even slighly different. My lungs and the size of my body is different. Interesting.
<i>Food.</i>
I yoink the food greedily and place the boxes on the cooking island, searching several drawers for utencils I might use. <i>If there are none, I'm about to devour this food like a cave woman.</i>
Found the silverware!
I hesitate with one box in hand, and a clean fork in the other, as small part of my brain mulling this over. If I did listen at this time, it would point out this is residual perspective, and it's way more complete than the classes suggested.
Not right now though, that voice is silent and slobbering over the food in front of me.
(Audio: chewing sounds)
I don't wait, and a soggy, cold, crab ragoon appears like magic on my fork. It goes into my mouth, the flavor exploding and filling my life with color. 
Well the flavor of cold cardboard. Its soggy, stale, and not very satifying... No crunch is left sadly.
To my body, it's gourmet steak with a bowl of fresh and piping hot ramen. My body is out of fricks to give. So? I grab another peice and shovel it down.
It takes a minute or two, but I manage to scarf down the entire take out box. 
(Audio: Gulp sounds)
Not even caring, I drink straight from the carton. Take that Mom!
Fresh, crisp and full of nom nom.
//(Audio: Burp sounds)
The gnawing feeling is receding quickly. I wipe the excess milk from my lips, smiling with contentment. 
I take in the rest of the room.
