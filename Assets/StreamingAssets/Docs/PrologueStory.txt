Male Bystander::
Dude.....I can't believe they are going through with this! That Poor Sod. What a dumbass man!
Female Bystander:: 
You would not catch me in that room at all. Why isn't VR good enough for people? Imagine being that kid's parents? I wonder what they think about this? 
<i>She shakes her head and sighs.</i>
The way it looks to me, it just seems like the kid is suicidal.
Male Bystander 2::
Fuck it! You only live once right? I mean....who wouldn't want to live in a virtual world? You wouldn't have to worry about eating, sleeping, showering, or anything like that. You just do what the fuck you want right?
Male Bystander::
<i>Scoffs and looks up at the Broadcast</i>
Yeah, the power goes out on whatever server you are on, does your brain get scrambled? Come on, haven't you been following the news? From what they said, you have to stay on a live server. They don't know what happens if you are saved on a hard drive. And let's not talk about the Machine! They have failed many, many times before they even had a live subject.
Quiet, they are starting!
