Male Bystander::
I can't believe they are going through with this! That Poor Sod. What a frickin idiot. 
Female Bystander:: 
You would not catch me in that room at all. Why isn't VR good enough for people? Imagine being that kid's parents? I wonder what they think about this? 
<i>She shakes her head and sighs.</i>
The way it looks to me, it just seems like the kid is suicidal.
Male Bystander 2::
Fuck it! You only live once right? I mean....who wouldn't want to live in a virtual world? You just do what the fuck you want right?
Male Bystander::
<i>Scoffs and looks up at the Broadcast</i>
Yeah, the power goes out on whatever server you are on, does your brain get scrambled? Come on, haven't you been following the news? From what they said, you have to stay on a live server. And let's not talk about the Machine! They have failed many, many mock tests before this event.  
Female Bystander::
Quiet, they are starting!

Today, Digital Horizons attempts to etch themselves into the history books by digitizing the first human, a feat which continues to be just a plot device in most science fiction movies. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a front row seat. At the Lab, we have our correspondant. John? Are you there?

Narrator::
<i>In front of the screen is a man in his 40s, dressed in a sharp dark grey suit, one hand fiddling with the ear piece. As he listens in, he nods curtly. He smiles broadly at the camera.</i>
John::
Thanks Barry! As you can see now, I am at the door of the main lab, where we will soon see the first human to be digtized walk through that door, <i>He motions off screen.</i> and become the first human to be transferred completely to the realm of the internet.  
Most folks at home have no idea what I am talking about, so I will clarify some information.
