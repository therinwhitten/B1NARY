Narrator::
New York City in Time's Square: the year is 2040. Midday on a blistering Summer Day.
On any normal day, most people can be seen milling around, heading to work, the cacophony of vehicles, pedestrians, and advertisements matching beat in a perfect harmony.
Not today...
Today, everyone's attention is fixed on the largest of the holo-screens in the sky.
In fact, every holo-display is now featuring the same broadcast, their sound in stereo across the square.
Cars are stopped dead in a silent gridlock. Pedestrians are murmuring, gazing up.
{additive: on}
No.
The world is about to witness a pivotal moment in humanity's history.
Today marks man's first attempt at digitizing one of their own.

The Holo-viewer, which before was on a short commercial break, abruptly changes to the image of a sharply dressed anchorwoman.
She smiles sweetly off screen. 
When she gazes at the front camera, her face takes on a more serious expression.

Narrator::
In front of the screen is a man in his 40s, dressed in a sharp dark-grey suit, one hand fiddling with his ear piece.
John::
As the news correspondant listens in, he nods curtly. 
John smiles broadly at the camera.
"Thanks Cindy! How have you been?"
Cindy::
{additive: on}
"Ohhhh John, I've been great! 
How are the kids?"

John::
"They're good!"
"Studying hard for the finals."

"I'm so happy for you, John! Tell Margie I said hi ok?"
John::
"On the off chance she <i>isn't</i> watching with the rest of the world, I will be sure and let her know."
Cindy::
"Who <i>wouldn't</i> be watching, today of all days?"
Narrator::
The two news-casters share a small chuckle.
Cindy::
{additive: on}
"Now, John.
The viewers have no idea what they're looking at here.
All I see behind you is a terrifying looking chair...
Is that what I think it is?"

John::

A curt nod.

"This is it, Cindy.
The Digital Imaging Human Interface. Or DIHI for short."
{additive: off}
Cindy::
{additive: on}
"Well... 
be my guest, John.
Walk us through it."
{additive: off}
John::
"As you can see, I'm at the door of the main lab." 
"Very soon we'll meet the first human chosen to be digitized."
John motions off screen.
"And they will come through <i>that</i> door..."
John sidesteps awkwardly as a few lab techs push past him in front of the camera.
"Oh, excuse me gentlemen." 
{fadeinsound: Door, 0.1}
{additive: on}
"Sorry about that!
Where was I?"
{additive: off}
{additive: on}
"Yes. Almost lost my train of thought there!
Digital Horizons is a company at the forefront of this technology, developing brain pattern replicators for over a decade."
{additive: off}
"Now you see Cindy, and the viewers at home, these brain pattern 'copies', also known as Synthgens, function normally as AI clones of online personalities. V-Tubers are an excellent example"
"Most of the time these Synthgens are being used when the streamer is offline, or when someone retires." 
Cindy::
"John? I'm a little confused." 
John::
"Yes?"
Cindy::
"Um... we already have Synthgens. What makes this machine different?" 
John::
John waggles his finger at the camera as if scolding an impatient child.
"I was getting to that." 
"The standard Synthgens have a huge drawback." 
"The copies break down over time. There is no brain to keep the patterns together." 
John's expression changes on camera. Focus sits behind his eyes. 
"So, just like any vegetable or fruit, it 'rots' over time. Expires naturally."
"Then new copies have to be recorded, and used to replace the deteriorated, old ones." 
"It is far from a perfect solution."
"So, what Digital Horizons has been working on for so long, is to <i>transfer</i> a human mind completely into the internet..."
Narrator::
The silence grows uncomfortable on the other end of the broadcast.
Cindy::
"Wait a second. Let me get this straight..."
"The person's <i>soul</i> is transferred? Meaning no one is home in the body?"
John::
"Yep!" 
"It's original purpose was to transfer a cancer patient's mind to a cyborg, or to allow astronauts time to learn new skills in cryostasis."
"But there are many applications this technology can be used for." 
"Hence the name. Digital Imaging Human Interface. It transfers the image of a human as a whole."
Narrator::
The female bystander scoffs openly on the street, gazing up in border-line horror.
Female Bystander::
{additive: on}
"Call it what it really is, John.
A brain sucking chair."
{additive: off}
Narrator::
Loud enough for the others to hear, the bystanders try to talk over the oohs and ahhs of the crowd surrounding them. 
Male Bystander::
"WOW! That is... impressive." 
"This really could change the world for the better."
"Even if it's risky, I think it is worth that risk." 
Male Bystander 2::
"Fuck yeah!"
"Innovation, and groundbreaking... and other stuff."
"Man I would love to be digitized."
"I could help out with the, uh ground breaking and stuff. Not to mention experience the more...entertaining parts of the internet."
Female Bystander::
Female Bystander let's out a tired sigh.
"So typical..." 
"Let me guess... Porn?"
Male Bystander 2::
Male Bystander 2 chuckles knowingly.
{additive: on}
"You know it babe!
We all know that's the primary reason for the internet.
Am I right?"

"Jokes aside though..."

"There is other stuff just as cool!

"You two are drowning out the broadcast."
The quip is sharp...
{spawnChar: malesilo, 2, Lab Tech }
{anim: Lab Tech, kime2}
{moveChar: Lab Tech, .85}
Narrator::
John is now standing next to a lab tech.
The technician build is tall and lanky, his glasses too large for the bridge of his nose.
His dark hair is tousled, as if he has been in lab for days without a proper bed. 
On the screen, his shoulders are slumped a bit, as if he is being crushed by all the camera's gazes. His voice, however, defies that impression.
The Lab Tech fingers his large glasses back up his nose.
Lab Tech::
"Once transferred, the testee will remain in our closed servers for a period of around four days, give or take." 
"While they're in there, the subject's body will remain in a form of warm air stasis. This is to prevent abrupt changes in the chemical makeup." 
"These chemical changes can create 'confusion' within the brain."
"We call this phenomenon 'Brain Discharge.' We want to avoid this effect until we have a better understanding of the long term implications." 
"The process-"
John::
John frowns slightly.
"Wait...'Brain Discharges'?"
Lab Tech::
The Lab Tech looks at the camera with a withering look, and tsks, shaking his head.
{additive: on}
"Yes... John, is it? 
A brain discharge. 
It's really too complicated to explain on air. 
Let's move on. I have things to attend to soon."
{additive: off}
Narrator::
The lab tech dismisses the reporter's confusion.
Lab Tech::
"Now, this process is currently untested on a human subject." 
"However, the experimental data from the synthgens has shown little to no adverse side effects."
"We will conduct the same tests we performed in the 'Synthgens Simulation'."
"They will stay awake and conscious in the server, conduct motor skill tests, recite poems, sing songs, and so on." 
"The purpose is to activate all the parts of the brain to ensure full congnition and awareness." 
"We want to see how much of the brain is active in cyberspace, and to be sure we can measure deterioration, if any..."
"After about four days, we will reanimate their body, reinsert the brain patterns back into their fleshy vessel, and put them in quarantine for a couple of months to ascertain no permanent damage was done." 
Cindy::
"Ask him if the synthgens from the first test are still ok John. John?"
John::
John taps the ear piece and looks toward the Lab Tech.
"Question er...."
Lab Tech::
The lab tech takes a sip of water and closes the lid tight.
"Name is Shirobi."
{changeName: Lab Tech, Shirobi}
John::
"Shirobi. What happens if something goes wrong while they are inside the server?" 
"What if you do see deterioration, and need to get them out as fast as possible?" 
"What are the steps to that process?"
Shirobi::
Shrobi shrugs nonchalantly. 
"If there are any issues that cause alarm, we will immediately transfer them back to their body."
"There will be a crew 24/7 monitoring both the body and the mind in the server." 
Shirobi looks directly into the camera, face serious, but confident.
"The subject of this test is well aware of the risks, and they are ready to be a pioneer in the field; making history in the process."
"I have complete confidence that this test will succeed with little or no issues." 
"That is <i>my</i> personal opinion, of course." 
John::
"And who is this pioneer of the future? The person that has decided to brave the unknown of the internet?"
{fadeinsound: Door,0.1}
Narrator::
The lab tech smiles for the first time at the sound of the door.
He starts guiding all the press out of the lab with an air of excitement.
Shirobi::
"Why, the courageous, pioneering spirit..."
