Yeah, the power goes out on whatever server you are on, does your brain get scrambled? Come on, haven't you been following the news? From what they said, you have to stay on a live server. And let's not talk about the Machine! They have failed many, many mock tests before this event.  
Female Bystander:: 
Quiet, they are starting!

Today, Digital Horizons attempts to etch themselves into the history books by digitizing the first human, a feat which continues to be just a plot device in most science fiction movies. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a front row seat. At the Lab, we have our correspondant. John? Are you there?

Narrator::
<i>In front of the screen is a man in his 40s, dressed in a sharp dark grey suit, one hand fiddling with the ear piece. As he listens in, he nods curtly. He smiles broadly at the camera.</i>
John::
Thanks Barry! As you can see now, I am at the door of the main lab, where we will soon see the first human to be digtized, walk through that door, <i>He motions off screen.</i> and become the first human to be transferred completely to the realm of the internet. Oh, sorry guys.

Sorry about that! Where was I? Oh yeah! Digital Horizons is a company at the forefront of AI technology, developing brain pattern machines for over a decade. These copies function normally as AI clones of V-Tubers. Most of the time these Synthgens are being used on a day off, or when someone retires. 
Barry::
John, John....
John::
Yes?
Barry::
Um...... we already have Synthgens. What makes this machine different? 
John::
I was getting to that. 
The copies, or clones, break down over time. There is no brain to keep the patterns together. So, just like any vegetable or fruit, it "rots" over time. Then the copies have to be recopied. It is not a perfect solution. 
What Digital Horizons has been working on so long is to TRANSFER a human mind completely into the internet.......
Narrator::
<i>The silence grows uncomfortable on the other end of the broadcast.</i>
Barry::
Wait what? The person's soul is tranferred? Meaning no one is home in the body?
John::
Yep! It's original purpose was to transfer a cancer patient's mind to a cyborg, or to allow astronauts time to learn new skills in cryostasis. But there are many applications this technology can be used for. 
They named it the Digital Imaging Human Interface, or DIHI for short.
Female Bystander::
You mean the Brain Sucking Chair John?
Male Bystander::
WOW! That is hype man! I didn't know they actually did it?! Porn, here I come! 
Female Bystander::
So typical........
Male Bystander 2::
Hey! We all know that is the primary reason for the internet! Imagine.....if you will, being able to visit all the porn stars! 
Yeah totally awesome. I am wondering if I should apply for the next test?
Male Bystander:: 
How can you two be loud enough to drown out the broadcast? Both of you quiet down please???

Narrator::
<i>John is now standing next to a lab tech, talking in hushed tones. He stands tall and lanky, wearing glasses too large for the bridge of his nose. On the screen, his shoulders are slumped a bit, as if he is being crushed by all of the camera's gazes. His voice, however, defies that impression.</i>
<i>The Lab Tech fingers his large glasses back up his nose.</i>
Lab Tech::
Once transferred, the subject will remain in our closed servers for a period of around four days, give or take. While they are in there, their body will remain in a form of warm air stasis. This is to prevent abrupt changes in the chemical makeup. These changes can theoretically cause "Brain Discharges" that we want to avoid until we have a better understanding. The process.....
John::
Wait....."Brain Discharges" ?
Lab Tech::
Yes, a brain discharge. It is really to complicated to explain on air. Let us move on. I have things to attend to soon. 
This process is currently untested on a human subject. However, monkey trials have been successful with little to no side affects. We will conduct the same tests we performed on the monkeys. They will stay awake and concious in the server, conduct motor skills, recite poems, sing songs. Many things to test different parts of the brain. 
We want to see how much of the brain is active in cyberspace, and to be sure we can measure any deterioration, if present. 
After about four days, we will reanimate their body, reinsert the brain patterns back into their fleshy mind, and put them in quarantine for a couple of months to ensure no permanent damage was done. 
Barry::
Ask him if the monkeys are still ok John.
Narrator::
<i>John taps the headphone and looks toward the Lab Tech.</i>
John::
Question er....
Lab Tech::
Name is Shirobi.
{changeName: Lab Tech, Shirobi}
John::
Shirobi. What happens if something goes wrong while they are inside the server? What if you do see deterioration and need to get them out as fast as possible? What are the steps to that process?
Shirobi::
If there are any issues that cause alarm, we will immediately transfer them back to their body. There will be a crew 24/7 monitoring both the body and the mind in the server. 
Narrator::
<i>Shirobi looks directly into the camera, face serious but confident.</i>
Shirobi::
The subject of this test is well aware of the risks. And they are ready to be a pioneer in the field, and make some history. I have complete confidence that this test will succeed with little or no issues. 
That is my personal opinion, of coarse. 
John::
And who is this pioneer, dare we say, even heroic, person that has decided to brave the unknown of the internet?
