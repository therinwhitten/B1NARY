Sample Model
Jin Natori - PRO

============================================================

　This model can be used to learn about arm changes that are used in commercial games and apps.

　The character is an original character created by Makoto Senzaki.
　The arm change is created by fading, allowing the user to learn 
　about the method of “expanding the range of expressions by 
　changing parts” that is used for purposes such as commercial games and apps.

　The set of files for embedding can be checked using Cubism Viewer 
　(for OW) so the user can learn how the original work flow data is structured.
