    <description>Odd's Very Special Xml Serializer is a Xml Serializer that is revolved around smart types; Explicit-type naming if needed.

			The system itself works very similar to how the XML serializer works normally, but is meant to be worked with the `object` or more 'undefined' data that the ordinary XML serializer have difficulty handling. You can turn this off for more traditional formatting with the config class, but it does reveal the issue once again. Additionally, It can handle reference types; allowing multiple separate fields that contain the same instance; It also allows you to connect a built-in debugger to specifically track what is wrong with the serialization/deserialization if needed.

			Unlike the traditional XML Serializer, this will use the type parameters in the class to automatically differentiate enums and arrays, which will remove the need to mark fields as `[XmlArray]` or `[XmlEnum]`.</description>
    <releaseNotes>Its been awhile lol
			preview 1:
			- Made most classes into a separate 'OVS' prefix to separate them from the system xml serialization more
			- Versions feature works a bit differently, i think null values are treated as 1.0 now?
			- Things like date-time and lists can have their own external compile config.
			- Normal IEnumerables are no longer written/serialized.
			- Removed the ignore xml enumerable and instead added a new attribute titled xmlignoreconfigs instead
			- Added some OSFile implementation that considers Unix and Windows systems for pathing info as an extra that probably would do better as its own library
			preview 2:
			- Added missing a single missing method regarding copying contents to a normal stream like a file stream.
			- Wrote some additional minor xml documentation.
			- Updated the readme a bit
			- Changed the namespace from OVSXmlSerializer to OVSSerializer to prevent some weird issues that may have to be fixed by using global::
			- Made some errors properly throw some exceptions.</releaseNotes>
